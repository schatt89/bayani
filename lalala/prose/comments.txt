Thank you, willis3000.  This seems to be bunk:  self-discipline doesn't standard-deviation out well.  How do you measure it?   It, unlike IQ, is highly subjective, and non-controversial.  

Perhaps more importantly, a two year study of eighth graders is just crap.   If they check back in in twenty years or so, this would perhaps have a shred of validity, but not a heck of a lot happens with eighth graders.  They tend not to start companies, write code or even novels, for whatever reason.   

I agree fundamentally that self-discipline is important, but even the most disciplined person cannot teach themselves eg, Lisp, if they lack the cerebral capacity.
This was the first Paul Graham article I read that brought me to the realisation that, like many bright people, Paul does not realise the boundary where the intelligence of his insights cease.

Not terrible.  But it really did bring me to the opinion that Paul is oblivious about (at least some of) his own limitations.

"We're good at making movies and software"

We are? Since when? In recent history Hollywood is routinely viewd as pumping out mostly utter crap.  Same with much of the shrinkwrap software industry, esp game industry.  Buggy, poor design, non-innovative.

Small things make good things, large things don't.  Hollywood is big == craptacular movies. Independents are small make good software.  Same with game industry.  smaller software companies make innovative, not as shitty software as giant corporations.  The larger the organization the larger the propensity of systematic design.

It's made clear that it's not in the nature of pitbulls to attack? Here's a direct quote from the article: 

"Most dogs fight as a last resort, when staring and growling fail. A pit bull is willing to fight with little or no provocation."

I'm not disputing the fact that most bad pit bulls have bad owners. But I'd much rather a bad owner raise a breed that doesn't "try to inflict the maximum amount of damage on an opponent".

I think the author's comparison to profiling is fitting. If profiling can help prevent the next 9/11, it's unthinkable to *not* use it as a preventitive tool. Likewise, if a town ordinance against pit bulls can help prevent my son from getting his face ripped off, I'm all for it.

"But it really did bring me to the opinion that Paul is oblivious about...his own limitations."

You've managed to set a table that all bashers of Paul G can admire without putting any legs under it.  Maybe your wisdom is obvious to the other "Aren't we so smart" folks in your club, but would you care to actually make an arguable statement?

The same article had the following quote: "Carl Herkstroeter, the president of the A.T.T.S., says. 'I’ve tested half of them. And of the number I’ve tested I have disqualified one pit bull because of aggressive tendencies. They have done extremely well. They have a good temperament. They are very good with children.' It can even be argued that the same traits that make the pit bull so aggressive toward other dogs are what make it so nice to humans. “There are a lot of pit bulls these days who are licensed therapy dogs,' the writer Vicki Hearne points out. 'Their stability and resoluteness make them excellent for work with people who might not like a more bouncy, flibbertigibbet sort of dog. When pit bulls set out to provide comfort, they are as resolute as they are when they fight, but what they are resolute about is being gentle. And, because they are fearless, they can be gentle with anybody.'

The author made an argument against the pit bull breed in the beginning of the article and then blew it apart with some of the text quoted above. His point was that pit bulls were not dangerous enough to ban, the image of the evil pit bull was just an unfounded sterotype. Just like the unfounded and useless sterotypes we have about what a terroist looks like.

A long long time ago 130kB was a pipe dream. And people back then wrote great software. Better than great!

Anyone on here old enough to remember the trusty old C64, or ZX Spectrum?

Yip, back then they had 48 or 64 kB, and boy did they make the most of it! Some of the later 3D games were absolutely amazing! There was a fixed hardware spec that stayed constant for quite a number of years - and all learned to work around the constraints and did great things.

I think, as in everything, he only cares about the top %1 (e.g. of programmers, because, he says, they write 99% of the software people actually use); therefore, he is saying that the top 1% of software and the top 1% of movies in America are fairly good, where they aren't as good in (say) Japan.
All I learned from my programming paradigms classes can be reduced to:

 * OOP is powerful, great for enterprise software, and better to get a high-paying blob-coding job.

 * Functional languages are very powerful and underused.

 * Lisp is more expressive, so I should use it rather than pure functional languages.

 * I can be more productive in Prolog than in any other language, but my code can become terribly obscure to understand later, so I better not use logic programming for any reasonable-sized project.

 * Newer paradigms are usually bullshit

Any comments from an experienced programmer?

Pit Bull Euthanized After Attack On DE 3-Year-Old

http://kyw.com/local/local_story_030182154.html

http://isteve.blogspot.com/2006/01/malcolm-gladwell-on-why-his-bestseller.html

Anyway, the anti-pit bull laws are hardly a direct analogy to racial profiling by police. A much closer analogy would be when the cops pay more attention to a pit bull running loose than to a Labrador retriever running loose. And is that really so morally reprehensible or pragmatically ineffectual?

But if you go look up the data on people killed by dogs, you find that of the 238 deaths from 1979-1998 for which the breed of dog is known, 66 were due to pit bull-type breeds (along with 10 people killed by part-pit bull mixed breed dogs). Pure-bred Rottweilers were far back in second place with 39 kills and pure-bred German Shepherds in third with 17. Unfortunately, we don't have terribly good data on the number of dogs by breed, but certainly the Labrador retriever is vastly more common than all the various pit bull breeds combined, yet only one person in those two decades was killed by a pure bred Labrador (and four by part Labradors). 

Moreover, the danger to children (who comprise about 70% of dog fatalities) from pit bulls relative to Labradors is even worse than these numbers suggest because sensible dog owners buy dog breeds based on likely exposure to children. If you have a small child, you are much more likely to buy a Labrador to be his pet rather than a pit bull. 

Gladwell misses the salient point about bulldog breeds -- they tend to be wonderfully loyal to their owners, but precisely because they are so monogamous in their loyalties, they can be dangerous to others, such as your child's friends, for example, if they get into a fight with your child. In contrast, Labradors are promiscuously friendly, so you don't have to worry about your Lab eating a guest who gets out of hand at your kid's birthday party.

building ugly cities is certainly not something that america does exlusively. one thing perhaps counting against cities in the states is that many are old cities now, compared to what is being developed in asia. if you were to develop a city now, you would base a lot of the decisions on what cities were in the past and how to improve on that model.

when i first saw the skyline of manhatten i was suprised by how antiquated much of it looked. but it is a very old 'modern' city so i don't know why it suprised me at first.  as the world's first (and probably still vying for the best) major metropolis it's a piece of living history. newer cities (or ones undergoing rapid redevelopment) have the benefit of standing on the shoulders of giants, say.

by 25, normals have an outgoing tact filter and nerds have an incoming tact filter.
by 35, everyone has an outgoing filter. nerds realize that tact is a control variable that they can tweak to affect the quality of their lives. the only exceptions by 35 are the super-rich or super-talented. this allows the people around them to tolerate the tactlessness with the hope of some gain. thus, these folks cannot have MORE comfortable lives by inculcating tact and may never realize that it is a control variable. unless they lose their riches/talent.
since you are tactful you dont piss anyone off. if you DO, your in-filter wipes the pissedness. so, not only tactful, but very deluded/happy etc. OTOH, most "successful" people seem to have these filters e.g. your Great Dictator has both filters for fact, instead of tact.

Emotional benefits from "things" decay with time. Emotional benefits from "experiences" increase with time. People chasing "things" may be more likely to get ADD, paranoia, dependency issues.

Summary: Tact filters can sweeten what is said or heard to be less hurtful. Normal people sweeten what they say (only). Nerds sweeten what they hear (only) as a learnt defence mechanism from childhood, when they were taunted a lot. All interactions work ok with this except when Nerds speak and Normals hear - there is no filter in between and the Normals may be hurt. Nerds should realize this.

What, exactly is a "pit bull-type breed"? Most people [wouldn't know](http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/findpit.html) a pitbull if it bit them on the rear, so they call any dog that bites people and is stocky looking a pitbull-type breed. That's a bit like calling any middle-eastern/south asian person who does something antisocial an Arab, then generalizing that Arabs should be viewed with suspicion because they want to blow us up.

People who want mean dogs tend to prefer muscular, powerful dogs because they're more intimidating. Sometimes it's pitbulls, sometimes rottweilers and sometimes some random breed you've never heard of that *looks similar* to a pitbull, but isn't related at all. My original point stands: it should be illegal for mean people to own dogs of any kind.
It is made clear that it is not in the nature of pitbulls to attack **humans**. They were bred with dog fighting in mind, and **do** tend to have above-average dog aggression.
I wonder if it takes practice to get this good at talking to people...

Graham also [says](http://paulgraham.com/popular.html)

"A good programming language should have features that make the kind of people who use the phrase "software engineering" shake their heads disapprovingly."

This is the attitude of a hacker. It's not the sort of thing that works with large teams or at (most) big companies, but such places don't produce good software.
I wouldn't claim to be an experienced programmer just yet, but I think I have enough experience to comment.

Languages that are "purely X" are great for teaching about X. For doing real work, it's optimal to have multiple paradigms available so you can use whatever techniques map most cleanly to the problem you're working on. In the real world, it also helps to have good libraries; that's one of the main reasons Perl is still as popular as it is.

I like using Ruby for small stuff and Common Lisp for big stuff. Your statement about Lisp also applies to Ruby; it's the most expressive non-Lisp language I've used.
Good point, but not necessarily. We could continue generating wealth faster than population growth forever and still have the above be true. That generated wealth just couldn't fall into our hands.

Link on why pit bulls are not all bad
I think any person of normal intelligence can learn lisp to a competent level. I have no proof of this, but I've met relatively stupid people capable to understand relatively complex things (hamming code, the calculus, monadic IO).

It's almost a truism that many intelligent people have self-discipline and will problems, they could do so much if they only tried, but for whatever reason they do not try hard enough. It could be a false stereotype, but I suspect there's something behind it.

Well, StarForce ain't no darling that's for sure, but publishers use them because it works. When I say "works", I mean publishers see it taking longer before cracked versions of games appear on torrent sites and newsgroups.

I'm not one to advocate StarForce's products (having installed Panzers: Phase I, a gorgeous game marred by StarForce) but there are other aspects of this issue than just malware snuck in by a legally bought game CD.

Fact is StarForce games are very hard to copy. Forget all the rest, because this fact is all the publishers look at.
Fact is that illegally copied games are threatening to suck the life out of PC gaming. Very few PC titles make sales numbers to numb the impact of illegal copying. For the rest, every single sale is important.

StarForce hasn't just come about because of cynical publishers, is my point. They have also come about because we, as PC gamers, do not feel the need to pay for PC games. If we want StarForce to go away, we have another part to play other than just complaining: We got to start paying for our PC games.

The article seems to state that preventing suicides is an inherently good thing. I'd say that the right of suicide (yes, I consider it a right) is a part of personal autonomy like any other. Sure, many people commit suicide because of clinical depression or with an unsound mind, but I don't think this is the case for all suicides. It can seem a strange idea that suicide might ever be justified, but I think if a person is sound of mine it's their choice whether they wish to keep on living.

i agree.  the tone of his reply is "ha ha starforce, now i'm sic'ing my minions on you."  and it's too bad that you and i are going to get modded down for this, just because other people *don't* agree.

for awhile there, i could convince myself that people were getting modded down not for unpopular views, but because they expressed them in an overly hostile way.  that could account for, say, two of the people that modded you down, because you have to admit, "attention whore" is far from neutral.  but the third guy, he modded you down just because you feel differently about cory doctorow than he does.  i've seen too many perfectly harmless and respectful comments that nonetheless get modded down to think otherwise.

Cringely says Google releases these to the general public just to confuse the competition.  Gmail would have been their biggest success that way -- a simple beta service run on a shoestring, that creates enormous headaches for Hotmail and Yahoo.

Corollary: People successful in narrow fields annoy us ordinary mortals by tending to think the considerations of their field are most relevant to a given problem or decision.

E.g. "I don't care how many features you can pack into a Lisp web server.  We put the server admins through three reorgs this year, and they'll all quit if we force them to learn weird new software."
And America-imitating countries here in Europe.
And of course, we all apply the inverse filter when using the internet.  To a lot of internet conversationalists, anything that might be a flame, is a flame.  It would be interesting to see if nerds, who apply tact on input, are more successful internet communicators than normal people.

Also open to further investigation: what is is about the internet that inverts our tact filters?  It can't just be that anonymity takes the consequences away, because people often do the right thing even in consequence-free situations ("on your honor" transactions, etc)
Hmm. People, help me out. I don't seem to get the entire point of this article/discussion.

Yeah, sure, great software can live in 130kB. So what. "Great software" can also live in 5kB, or in 526kB, or in 301MB, or in [insert value of your choice here][insert unit of your choice here]. 

What's "great software" anyway? You can't seriously compare what's "great" or "useful" today with what was great or useful in 1960. Come on, give me a break. Tetris can live in 130kB. But you can't surf the Web or steer a jumbo jet with Tetris. 

Is µTorrent great *just because* it lives in 130kB? Then I could just as well argue that µTorrent is total crap because it doesn't fit 191 bytes.

I wish articles like this would include in what context this tidbit was revealed.  Out of context, it sounds smug, but who knows?
I think your definition of 'discipline' is a little off. 

Entrepreneurs are the definition of discipline.  They do hard things for a long time in the hopes of very large amounts of gratification when it's all over.

What entrepreneurs don't have is the "checklist" mentality that we've all been conditioned to believe is important by the public school teachers and IRS drones.  In fact, the same "fuck what you say, I'm gonna get rich" mentality that drives entrepreneurs would tend to make them 'underachievers', as you put it.
yes, it's a person's choice whether to die or not.  but you want them to make that choice based on reality, not misguided perceptions.

the article mentions that thomas joiner's dad killed himself, and the implication is that he did so under the mistaken impression that he was unwanted and unappreciated.  if he'd brought that up, it may have prevented joiner's family from losing a member.
i would say no, not inherently.  for example, if i fall off a horse and end up like christopher reeve, well, i will be ready to go.
Good point. I was just getting a bit nostalgic. The good thing about µTorrent IMO is that it uses less CPU compared to the client I was using before (Azureus). How big the code is isn't important.

yeah, agreed. there must be someone reading that stuff
&gt;You miss the point. He's saying the book has little value precisely because the author more or less purposefully (through his selection criteria) created a caricature of America.

No. His point is that he thinks it is mocking Americans and there's no point for a book that openly mocks Americans to be written in English. This is despite the fact that his description of the text made it look a lot like Alistaire Cooke's [Letters from America](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/default.stm) or even his own Prarie Home Companion radio broadcast. The only reasons I can imagine he wouldn't think the book should be translated into English would be he's pandering to anti-French sentiment or he simply forgot about the rest of the English speaking world. Considering the fact that he does Honda commercials in Britain, I'm guessing he's pandering.

&gt;As for the obesity issue, there are two things wrong with your statement. One, Keillor is 64 years old. A cursory search on the web shows that about 60-75 percent of men his age are overweight.

So what?

&gt; Two, yes, he's taking issue with the notion that all Americans are fat, because it's simply not true.

I haven't read the book, but nowhere in the review did he say it claims all Americans are fat. Although 60-75% is a significant majority.

Take into consideration that the fact that Bernard-Henri Lévy is directly competing with Keillor through this book. Would you seriously consider GM's reviews of Honda's cars? Microsoft's critiques of Apple's software?

The placebo effect is the same as the conscious decision to get better.
Fat people who take any action towards losing weight will necessarily lose more weight than people who take no action. Extremely few people would completely rely on the magic pill and the magic pill alone, and the placebo effect is measuring a statistical aggregate:  Some lose weight, while some have no effect... The total is a net aggregate effect.

Another somewhat related effect.  I can cure my headaches and coughs by simple conscious decision that it should go away.  Headaches are more challenging to consciously manage than coughs, but with enough time and concentration, it goes away.  A key word there is TIME.  Whether or not I have any real conscious power over my health, time alone cures.  And wrapped in the placebo effect is both of those.
The historical mistake of science is to have attached the power of delusion to the medical and pharma intervention, is one of self importance.

One way to test this theory as an explanation of the placebo effect would be to seperate smokers into 2 groups.  Ones who have no interest in quitting and those with varrying inclinations towards quitting.

People with no interest in quitting smoking will be unlikely to quit even if given chemicals with real nicotine substitutes.

People who get advice from a plumber (expert) are more likely to get a plumbing problem fixed even when the plumber doesnt do any real work, than those people who do not seek expert advice.

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming."  -- C.A.R. Hoare

I thought this was attributed to Knuth.
While I agree with you on your reasons for down-modding a comment, if "disagreement isn't a bad thing" then why should you care whether or not people down-mod your comments?  :P

(for the record I didn't mod you in either direction)
It seems to me the major point is that functionally *identical* software can live in, say, 700KB or 30MB, and that those other 29.3MB are therefore, well.. What, besides unnecessery?

And no, you couldn't make that argument, because it is pretty much impossible to fit it in that much - there's probably more concepts involved than bytes. Oh sure, maybe if the language has enough libraries - i.e. with the unaddressed 'library cheat' you could. 

With almost any language, you regularly refer to implementations, be it the VM's code, a dynamically linked library or somesuch. With compiled language, you usually compile a considerable part of implementation into your executable, for speed - and also there's static linking, which are usually used to have something not break when your set of installed libraries isn't quite the same, a lesser evil in the imperfect environment that is 'pick a computer, any computer'. Of course, by just the size measure that would make it suck.

Then again, consider for example centericq; I disassembled it once because I could not get my head around why the executble alone was 8MB. It turned out to mostly be compiled templates, that were probably mostly never used. Its creators probably didn't want to rewrite everything
without templates, and it worked. That sort of attitude isn't necessarily bad, but it does bloat things beyond what is necessary.

Then consider MenuetOS - 1.4MB, and is a complete graphical operating system with networking and a few games. Sure, it's an extreme case because it's written in assembly. But on the other hand, why can't everything compile that well? GCC uses RTL, which I suppose adds overhead by translation to x86 being imperfect, but still.

The fact that identical functionality can be implemented in code many, *many* times as big/small is not only bloat, it's regularly an indication of the bored "add bits of code to this IDE here until they seem to work" attitude I fear goes into many things.

Hmm.
Of course, Joel's point about swapping is very good - even if it's relying on the OS-based workaround, the workaround *is* effective.

I should have added that what I meant with unnecessary bloat is "with the same amount of work, planning and consideration," which is a little iffy as an argument because convenience is likely the largest reason for bloat.
The article was interesting but I HATE roundabouts.  The only roundabout where I live is at the University I go to... and everybody there drives/walks/bikes like they own the place.

An absolute fantastic novel
Indeed it is. I'm not saying I condone StarForce, but the reason it is being used is because it works. Publishers find very few legal customers have issues with StarForce (http://forums.ubi.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/1851065692/m/8121095173) and they see their sales go up as a result of using it.

totalGainFromStarForce = SalesGainFromStarForce - AnnoyedCustomersLossFromStarForce

Since StarForce is in use, and more and more so, totalGainFromStarForce is positive seen from the perspective of publishers.

I'm not saying "don't complain". I'm saying that if SalesGainFromStarForce declined (i.e. using StarForce would not increase sales), the totalGainFromStarForce would get negative faster than if we just work on increasing AnnoyedCustomersLoss. We have to make it an interesting proposition to not use StarForce and at the moment we're only working with the one variable. We're not being as effective as we could be.

"Only the most paranoid clients phone me in my sleep." - Greg Egan, Quarantine
I like the idea of a short summary when the title can't explain it all. Thank you. But I dont think he says this: People chasing "things" may be more likely to get ADD, paranoia, dependency issues. I do not think he put down the cause/effect, but just says they are related.
i've always liked this one:

"The only advice I can offer, should you wake up vertiginously in a strange flat, with a thoroughly installed hangover, without any of your clothing, without any recollection of how you got there, with the police sledgehammering down the door to the accompaniment of excited dogs, while you are surrounded by bales of lavishly-produced magazines featuring children in adult acts, the only advice I can offer is to try be good-humoured and polite."

- 'The Thought Gang' by Tibor Fischer
Article deflating the hype surround the term Web 2.0 and pointing out that actually this stuff all existed ages ago, it just works now.
Another excellent view of authentic eastern thought. Excellent excellent!
On the not-so-useful-software side, the demo scene always comes out with great stuff in 64kb or 4kb. Farbrausch ruled for quite a while and then there was this insane RGBA 64kb intro:
http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12821

Already 1.5 years old... Probably better ones exist now.
Articles like this always seem to make people worry about the nationality of corporations.  In 20 years, after Ford and GM have been strangled by their unions and atrocious product design, there will sill probably be car plants in America.  They'll make Kias and Toyotas, be 30% owned by New York investment banks, get their raw materials from Australia, etc.

All of these comments are predicated on the idea that there isn't enough work to go around.  That's ludicrous.  Work is the only thing in the world whose supply is unlimited.
I enjoyed reading the financial advisor's emails. It's hard to tell what their business relationship is like: frustration? disappointment? fear? or does the guy just feel acceptance towards ellison acting like a spending nut? anyway, it's hilarious. You can't blame Ellison... he's got the money to spend and he earned it, but what's the deal with all the Japanese stuff?
An interesting perspective, but one that I disagree with completely.  People are happiest when their wealth is increasing, not if it is just high.  In this way they compare themselves to their past selves.

Even the author is unhappy because he could not walk on property that the owner previously allowed him to.

He mentions that in the US, average well being has declined, but draws the wrong conclusion, which is that everyone getting wealthier is the problem.  The problem is when government prevents people from earning and keeping wealth, people have no choice to compare themselves to their neighbors rather than simply looking at their own progress.

And finally, the author sounds a bit like a spoiled child when he asserts that people have a "right" to walk on property they do not own.  How about a "right" to drive other people's cars, or live in other people's houses when they're not at home?

I agree that convenience/laziness is a factor. However, I'm not sure if it's the largest one. 

For instance, we shouldn't forget the ever-shrinking time-to-market. Let me repeat that. *Ever* since the first piece of software was created, the time-to-market has been *continuosly* shrinking. 

In the same time, the number of features has been *constantly* rising.

The deadline for your application is slipping and your boss (or even worse: your customer) comes in and tells you to cram in yet another 2057 new features in 14 minutes. So you just copy&amp;paste 10,000 lines of code, then edit, like, 1-2 of them, and commit so you can ship on time. Sound familiar?

So the actual problem ain't always laziness. 

On the one hand, the customers' patience ain't endless. On the other hand, *most* customers just don't care whether your software is 700kB or 30MB. So there you have it.

Ah, and for you Joel Spolsky fans out there: 

"Ask Lotus. When they first shipped 123 version 3.0, it required an 80286 computer, which wasn't very common then. They delayed the product by 16 months while they worked to shoehorn it into the 640K memory limit of the 8086. By the time they were done, Microsoft had a 16 month lead in developing Excel, and, in a great karmic joke, the 8086 was obsolete anyway!"

"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents."
 - H. P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu (1926)
It's relevant in teaching new concepts, especially in the bootstrapping stage.

When teaching you have to lead people on a mental journey from the known, into the unknown. That requires words. Design patterns give us a rich vocabulary of words, and everyone seems to agree about what the words mean. It makes a wonderful foundation to build on.

Here the author is trying to explain monads, an unknown concept, to a bunch of mainstream programmers. Mainstreamers these days know OO and design patterns. So starting from there is it possible to bootstrap some useful monad examples? Apparently so.

I have read quite a number of monad explanations, trying to get a handle on how I might understand and use monads. This one did it for me.

So I applaud the author's use of vocabulary. That "Maybe" example got me past the blank stare stage.

Everything here is ganked from Wikipedia - what's so difficult about citing sources?
Yeah.  I agree.  Still, at least it's a fairly balanced account on a subject that's almost as polarized as the red/blue state issues.

The best ever first paragraph (not strictly what we were after, I realise) from Clive Barker's Weaveworld.

"Nothing ever begins. There is no first moment; no single word from which this or any other story springs. The threads can always be traced to some earlier tale, and to the tales that preceded it; though as the narrator's voice recedes the connections wil become more tenuous, for each age will want tale told as if it were of it's own making. Thus the pagan will be sanctified, the tragic become laughable, great lovers will stoop to sentiment, and demons dwindle to clockwork toys. Nothing is fixed. In and out the shuttle goes, fact and fiction, mind and matter, woven into patterns that may have only this in common: hidden amongst them is a filigree which will with time become a world.

Some woman -- it may have been Mary Matalin, but if so she's aged a lot and and not very well -- made the most horrible face right behind Bush's back. I think she was saying "And next, Bobo &lt;i&gt;eat Romaaaaaaaaania&lt;/i&gt;." Probably the most sensible statement of evening.
I'll upmod it. It bothers me that Mugabe is looked at, at worst, as some sort of backwards guy who means well. Hello, the guy stole land from farmers and bulldozes houses for fun. And then he gets a standing ovation at the UN when he bitches out Dubya. Believe me I'm no fan of Bush, but I'm realistic enough to say that despite his follies, he hasn't starved half of America yet or made a quarter of New York homeless.

“I against my brothers, my brothers and I against my cousins, my cousins, my brothers and I against the world.”

This isn't about Black vs White, it's the difference between an 'Indvidualist' society versus a culture that places more importance on the 'Group'. All cultures fall somewhere in the continuum  between extreme individualism and 'Borgism' - it's just that Americans (and Protestent Europeans in general?) fall on one end of the line and often have a hard time comprehending the "crazy" motivations of others.
It seems to me that the problem must be that the confiscation and subsequent redistribution was poorly managed.

I cannot say I see it as a grievous historical wrong to have wealth built on slaves back be redistributed to benefit said slaves descendants at large.

Of course, it is better when it does not have side-effects like starvation.

---

On a slightly different note... I find the "white people" mentality from white people to be quite ludicrous.

If someone non-caucasian can't be bothered to differentiate, oh well.  But really... truly... do Americans have much more of a cherished brotherhood with Russians, Danes, Estonians, Italians, Serbians, Albanians, Portugese, and Georgians then they do with Malaysians, Koreans, Japanese, Kenyans, and Egyptians?

I define myself primarily by my ethnocultural background, and find being grouped in with "white people" to be on the offensive side.  There are lot of specific white people I find quite distasteful and reprehensible, and a number of mostly caucasian countries whose general trends I would characterise likewise.  Being included with "white people", I really feel, puts me in some bad company.

I expect I have more meaningfully in common with quite a lot of non-caucasians than I do with hordes of cacuasians not of my own ethnocultural background.

So, unlike most people it seems, reading about "white farmers" having their land confiscated does not arouse the least bit of emotion in me.

Mostly because "white farmers", the way I read it, really stands for "well-to-do descendants of wealthy owners of African slaves".  And my ancestors going back at least a millenium, almost certainly did not own slaves of any sort, and couldn't possibly have owned african slaves due to details of history and geography.

So... these poor, poor "white farmers" are nothing like me, though I may be caucasian, and elicit no fraternal empathy from me whatsoever.

Sorry for the long rant... but it irritates me that there seemingly was an expectation that the description would elicit an emotional response.  And it irritates me that from many it does, even though the most meaningful thing they have in common with said farmers is skin-colour.

They are upmodding it, probably because Mugabe is fashionable to hate as "a little Hitler", even (or perhaps especcially) by  people who are oblivious to most details and facts about him and/or his country.

Not if they want to die.

People have different utility functions. To most people, pain has negative utility, but to a masochist or a mystic it might have positive utility. To most people life is desireable, in the balance of things the utility sum (or the expected utility sum later in time) turns out positive. But if all there is in front of you is unhappiness, dissatisfaction, generally speaking negative utility states, then yes, dying is a good thing.

No insight can be gained from such a short article.
Journalists, especially Brittish media, are very keen on pointing out Mugabe's shortcomings. What they will *never* point out if how much the economic sanctions are harming Zimbabwe.
Here's a more balanced view:

http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/sanctions32.13170.html

Once again, it seems to me that the West isn't concerned about democracy and the welfare of the people. Rather, it angers them that white farmers of European descent have been destituted from land that, in effect, was stolen land. Was it not? Do we expect colonial ownership and heritage in 2005? I mean, for real...Mugabe is scum. But such biased journalists (on a payroll?) are scum too.
There's an agenda here. Watch out when you read such reports on the Western media. Get the fact from different angles.
I usually mod up dupes where the first one is really old (like this one), but mod down dupes of stories that were posted in the last day or two.
The reason the article deserves to me modded down is that it is very short, biased and uninformative.
Interesting if true.  There were a lot of people there.  I would like to hear some sort of corroboration of her story.
You're absolutely right when you comment on this use of the terminology "white farmers."
It is a terminology either specifically designed to spur empathy, or, at best, coming from someone who has very little respect or concern for the specific historical issues that revolve around the issue. Either way, it just debases the journalist who employs such terminology. In fact, ironically, the ones who do use those terms are just agreeing with Mugabe's own distorted, hypocritical and demagogical point-of-view and manipulation tactics.
Roundabouts are easy if you use them a lot.  Here in the UK they're everywhere.  Milton Keynes, near where I live, is a new city built with a grid system of roads, and the entire thing is done with roundabouts, no traffic lights.  Accidents are few and far between.

I'm not the right person to ask about Ruby's module system. I use Ruby for small stuff because it's easy. Ruby is great for the same things people use Perl and shell scripts for. It's great for quickly adding some dynamic behavior to otherwise static HTML - like PHP. Lisp is not so good for these things, but if something is going to be more than a few hundred lines, I'd rather use Lisp. This has more to do with the strengths of Lisp than the weaknesses of Ruby.

Knowing that a breed has a tendency to be dog-aggressive means that you can deal with it so it doesn't become a problem; neuter the dog early, expose it to lots of other dogs while it's a puppy, repremand it immediately if it acts aggressive.

Most dog breeds have traits that can cause serious problems if not handled correctly. You should know what those traits are before you get a dog so you can properly train your dog.

when i was younger i had a real problem disagreeing with people effectively.  i'd often scrape their egos so badly that they didn't want to have anything further to do with me.  obviously that was hurting me more than it was them.  i think i've gotten better at interpersonal relating as i've gotten older, but i still have to watch my behavior.

i'm starting to predict what the final score of each of my comments will be as i write them.  my predictions are getting better.  with enough practice, i will be able to use this experience to soften my interactions with people in the real world.

I'm Venezuelan, so I've first hand experience about Chávez.
IMO this article is true from head to tail.

I've been victim of discrimination last year because I signed a petition to remove Chávez from the presidency. The information contained the petition, which contained about 2+ millions of signatures, was suposed to be private, only for the eyes of the CNE (National Electoral Council), which is (in theory) an independent body responsible for the elections of legislative an executive powers. Well, the CNE gave this info to a chavista congressman named Luis Tascon (http://www.luistascon.com/), who in turn published it in his web page! Now the list is removed from the pageafter Chávez ordered to bury it, but there are still a lot of CDs, widely distributed which can be consulted.
http://daniel-venezuela.blogspot.com/2005/04/tascon-list-modern-political-apartheid.html
http://www.venezolano.web.ve/archives/472-Chavez-ordeno-enterrar-la-lista-de-Luis-Tascon.html

The result of these actions was that many public employes were fired, and no person who apeared on that list could aply for a job in the government and government owned companies (like PDVSA). In my case, I was aplying for a contract to make a software system for the National Superintendence of Cooperatives, and my proposal was dismised because I signed for the revocatory referendum (I was explicitly told so!)

And, to add a recent event that doesn't appear in the article, at the end of an act that declares open a new year of operation for the legal system in Venezuela, the Supreme Court of Venezuela and all the judges of the country chanted a popular chorus sang in political gatherings pro-Chávez that says: Uh, Ah, Chávez no se va (Uh, Ah, Chávez stays)

This is the measure of the independence of powers in Venezuela, more than half of the judges (the ones that weren't chavistas) have been replaced by "temporal" judges, being their status of temporal ideal to control them, or remove them if they become uncontrolable.

I believe it's also generally known that it is easier to recall something if you're in the same state that you learned it in.

I wonder if this could be used to recreate useful mental states.  Say, remember, as best you can, a time when you were very receptive to information before you start learning, remember a time when you were relaxed to help you relax, etc.
Whitacre doesn't understand the economics of peering.  He thinks that if Google isn't directly paying AT&amp;T for an OC48 or GigE into their datacenters, for example, then they're "stealing" bandwidth from AT&amp;T because all of AT&amp;T's downstream customers have end users surfing porn on Google Images and Google Video all day.  He doesn't understand that AT&amp;T and their downstream customers are also hosting web sites that the other carriers' downstream customers are surfing porn (or whatever) on all day.

What's changed is probably mostly that Vonage has become successful and AT&amp;T has a competing VoIP service.  Also Google and other companies are making a lot of money and AT&amp;T's dazed and confused CEO is wondering where his piece of the action is.

It seems like you're saying Mugabe isn't so bad.  What's up with that -- do you have information to support?
I remember fondly the hoopla she stirred up outside Bush's ranch in August. It was a comedic political quandry for the administration: they couldn't frontally attack a grieving mother of a dead soldier without abandoning the visceral high-ground they cherish. She was like Fox News Kryptonite.

Unfortunately, nobody got her a political advisor, or at least a competent one, 'cause she started hanging out with Hugo Chavez. Way to go, you just alienated your moderate supporters and are now left with the fringes that would have been there had you never existed.

It'd be interesting to see what the author would make of the "faith-based" governance of islamic theocracies in the middle east, or tribal governments on reservations.

I happen to think that the "Idiot America" phenomenon has a lot less to do with the particular culture of 'muricans and more to do with a general human attribute that people instinctually tend to respect authority (note: I say TEND TO), and a lot of these people are using a populist "I'm no expert" ruse as a badge of such authority.
As a member of the free internet community, I call for an end to AT&amp;T.
Yes, it is wrong. Chavez didn't produce anything that he is "giving away." That's how communism works. You deem Chavez admirable for taking (by force) from those who have more than what he considers "enough" and redistributing it to those who he says "need" it. How can the heating oil be "free" if it cost FREEDOM?
Perhaps when they talk about the subject at hand, yes. But often times they are incorrect in spite of their knowledge of a given subject, mainly because facets of that subject are interjecting in a larger context, and the nerd, seeing the subject he recognizes, assumes more authority than is wise. A good example is how many nerds openly wonder why software tool/language/application X isn't used by everyone everywhere. The nerd might be an expert in such a case, but he is ignorant of the fact that different people have different needs and maybe some people just aren't interested in it.

Note: this also applies (in fact, quite readily) to "normal" people where their political convictions are involved.
what optimal said.
She was only "asked to leave", though, not arrested.
So what? Who in their right mind would want to live in a country where they can be arrested for their t-shirt?

Such a bad choice for the name. I'll bet most people are pronouncing it "you-torrent" rather than "mu-torrent".
i'll give utorrent a shot. anyone have any negative points about it?
How far can they take it before people as a whole get sick of terrorism? In my mind I automatically reject anything that uses terrorism as an excuse, because if I accept it that means terrorism is working. Now if we need a program to beef up security because we find it lacking, lets do it, examine the issues at hand, and not use the T word.

It just seems like the more they do these "media blitz" things, the more obvious it becomes that they are just trying to control the country with fear. The sad thing is that many (not all) Fox users are actually succeptable to this.

It is just making me sick how much terrorism is working, many Americans are living in fear, and the government is just faning the flames.
i was pronouncing it mu-torrent until the article pointed out that it was micro-torrent. i'm also an idiot. "micro" clearly makes sense.
Okay, so this article is too simplistic, even if it shares the view that Mugabe is a very bad man.  Assuming you don't like sanctions, what are our other options?

To paraphrase [Matt Welch](http://mattwelch.com/old/2001_11_04_lettersarchive.html#6944345):

* Economic aid: suggests we implicitly support what the regime is up to.  see Egypt, Indonesia
* Humanitarian aid: allows the regime to continue to neglect its own people, when the aid itself doesn't get stolen.  See Nigeria, Afghanistan
* Trade: Legitimizes the regime and gives it a financial lever to use on us.  Opportunity for large corporations to profit from the repression.  See Saudi Arabia, China.
* Economic Sanctions: Make the situation worse.  
* Military Attack: Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq Iraq Iraq.  Really, the less said, the better.
* Doing Nothing: We can't just sit here while they kill or brutalize thousands of people.  Are we racist monsters?  See: Sudan, Rwanda, Bosnia.
agreed.
&gt; This isn't crap, but it is old and already well-known. Why post it here?

There is a fundamental assumption by link engines (reddit, digg) that links as a resource are unlimited. They are not. Because a link to a story, article, picture has variable quality. So a scarcity of good stories being released on any one day forces karma hungry users to look to the past.

At some stage I think reddit may place more value on comments on stories, images, etc rather than the mere link itself. This is one thing slashdot has got right.
It's missing: "There was no possibility of taking a walk that day" from Jane Eyre, one of the most famous opening lines ever.

I also rather like Ishiguro's "It seems increasingly likely that I really will undertake the expedition that has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days." from Remains of the Day.

And Saul Bellow has another nice one in “Shortly after dawn, or what would have been dawn in a normal sky, Mr. Artur Sammler with his bushy eye took in the books and papers of his West Side bedroom and suspected strongly that they were the wrong books, the wrong papers.” From Mr. Sammler’s Planet.
Ugh.  This is one topic that needs more serious thought and less petty politicking:  If you can agree with a fascist neocon on this one you should savor it.

Some of these Palestinians would shoot you both as soon as look at you.
negative filters: Go to prefs and check the box next to "don't show sites after i've disliked them".  Then dislike anything you don't, well, like.  And it's gone.  Problem solved.  Next?  Ah yes...

"zippit": Seems you've already found the solution: summarize the content of the link in a comment.  If you're right and Reddit needs summaries, then your comments will get lots of likes.

Excellent.  Now they need to apply this technology to home carpeting, furniture upholstery and clothes.  Or at least mine.

Good call buddy to whoever caught this article.  Goes in tune with the $200 billion telecom scam and the AT&amp;T make Google et al. pay for it's traffic too!!
Oh I barely do any web programming. No wonder I haven't really run into Ruby. :)
ExxonMobile made almost $11 Billion in profit last quarter - record profit for any US company ever (and they made $36Billion for the year).  This in the aftermath of Katrina &amp; Rita putting much of the Gulf of Mexico production out of commission causing gasoline, natural gas and heating oil prices to skyrocket.  Can you say 'theft'?

According to wikipedia, in Venezuela "The oil sector operates through the government-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA)".  Government owned.  So how is Chavez giving oil to poor US citizens any different than the US giving aid to poor people with AIDS in Africa?

Poor, poor Larry.  A single tear rolls down my cheek.

Software lets users play videos and MP3s and offers easier access to digital images.
Regardless of if Hugo Chavez is a saint or satan, he is largely portrayed in the states as a nutcase who solidifies his political popularity in Venezuela by regularly embarking on Anti-US diatribes. The middle ground (moderate) portion of the US electorate are the sought after ones, since voters of the right and left are pretty much entrenched. In the politics of perception ('truthiness'), foreign leaders who rail against the one's home country automatically raise the defensive flags, and are an anathema to be associated with politically.

Like it or not, politics are all perception, and that wouldn't be such a bad thing if the average citizen's perception ran deeper than 15 second soundbites on 24 hour news stations.
Because our freedom of speech includes the right to peacefully protest by wearing a !@#$ing T-shirt and not saying a bloody word whilst an audience member at a State of the Union address. She wasn't permitted to do that. They threw her out (unlawfully) for it. They arrested her (unlawfully) for it.

Yeah, we're all free to rant and rave mindlessly (or even mindfully) online or in public where people rarely pay attention, but we're being severely curbed and restricted in what we say to people in *control* of anything. That's officially Very Bad.
Aww, but GoogleCola would be based on heuristic search algorithms of what everybody else thought it should taste like, and would probably be delicous!
Well, I think qualifying the redistribution of historical slave-owners' land as "stealing" is deceptive at best, delusional at worst.

Is the US government stealing when it makes use of eminent domain?  It may be a stupid cliché, but it's true... if the government is doing it, it's legal (assuming they had a modicum of foresight with recent legislation).

Buldozing houses for fun?  Probably not his finest hour.  But it rather seemed to me like a dumbly orchestrated aid grab.  Did he fully reject the UN tents or did he cave in eventually?

As for starving half the country--that's a malicious lie.  His government's policies (whether heavily influence or solely guided by him) had the unfortunate side-effect of causing food supply problems.  Presumably he did not confiscate the farms of the white people in a devilish plot to starve the black people.

Anyways... rafuzo, it seems to me, was merely reciting the soundbites from some media establishment of about Fox News' level of reputation.

I'd welcome new information about Zimbabwe.  If I am wrong, I am wrong... but when government officials and media start mischaracterising a foreign government's or leader's actions in order to make it/him/her look immoral or evil... well, when a person is really evil, you only have to tell the truth to get people to agree with you.  It is when there is plentiful moral ambiguity that governments need to start making up stuff to sway the masses in the intended direction.
Actually, Malkin never said that.  Besides, the post is about the Danish cartoons and not about Japan or WWII at all.

Basically, a bunch of raving lunatics with guns threatened to take hostages over a series of cartoons.  Malkin suggests this is insane.  You suggest that to find this behaviour disturbing    infers that Americans don't believe anything.
Remember that karma on Reddit is not just about posting the link before anyone else does.  How well you write the headline has a lot to do with how a link gets modded.
It is amazing to me that millions of people spend their money on lotteries, HOPING to win when all odds are against them. If you compare lottery odds against the odds of dying it becomes incongruous to me to ever think of buying a lottery ticket again.
The feds have been pusing for this for years, and it always seems to fail.  I'm not quite worried yet.
It not 'theft' if ExxonMobile did not FORCE customers to buy their fuel.


"So how is Chavez giving oil to poor US citizens any different than the US giving aid to poor people with AIDS in Africa?"

There's very little difference. If it is wrong for you to rob Peter to pay Paul, it is wrong for Uncle Sam too.
Because Chavez is actually doing it whereas the US is just saying ["don't have sex, please"](http://www.guardian.co.uk/aids/story/0,7369,1262718,00.html).
Hmmmm... perhaps you are right, and there is no way to come out smelling like roses.

But it's not like Zimbabwe is killing or brutalizing people.  Surely there is some difference between: 1) white farmers becoming poor, 2) poor people losing housing, 3) some [lots?] poor people having increasingly less food available to them, and 1) racially/ethnically motivated murdering and raping of your own people.  In fact not many of the countries you mention are in particularly the same league.  Zimbabwe seems pretty harmless by most of the comparisons you implied. 

I personally would argue for non-intervention, mixed with sensible levels of aid and trade.  You cannot impose order from the outside.  It must come from within.

If people are being oppressed, they must rise up.  That is as true in Zimbabwe as it is in the United States.

Of course, western countries dislike genuine revolutions; because the resulting governments tend to treat them with well-earned distrust.  But it really is the best way on the long run, I think.  A genuine revolution that succeeded in paving way to a new and stable state is a historic triumph.  A coup by a minor faction funded by foreign money however is a source of national shame, whether hidden or widely known.
Actually very funny, but I don't like it.  It seems like stooping to his level.

Severely curbed?  You have a strange definition of 'severe'.  You think disallowing protests in the House gallery during a joint session with the Supreme Court and the President is a severe limitation to the right of free speech?

Insisting that the right to protest should be extended to all places and all times is less than useful.  Claiming that the House gallery should be available for protest without restriction is an absolutist position that seems unworkable to me.

It might not be OK.  But it's still useful to understand that dog-aggression and human-aggression are are not significantly correlated behaviors.  Must people instinctively (and wrongly) assume that they are.

APBTs are also not bred to "try to inflict the maximum amount of damage on an opponent".  They are bred to "grab and hold".  This makes a lot of sense when you look at the rules surrounding an organized dog fight.  If APBTs were really bred to do maximum damage they would try to bite many times and in many places and traditionally bred APBT simply won't do this.

See the APBT FAQ for more details about organized dog fighting:

http://www.nyx.net/~mbur/apbt.html

The FAQ also provides a lot of other interesting information about the breed.

And a quick note about bite stats:

Zak pointed in an earlier post to the the excellent "FIND THE PITBULL" page:

http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/findpit.html

It's not hard to understand why so many "pit bull" attacks are wrongly attributed to the breed.  If you're really interested in the subject, you might also want to take a look at "Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog" by Vicki Hearne.  It's a good and interesting read.  In it she does a bit of investigation into a number of "pit bull attacks" and it actually almost funny what breeds get transformed into "pit bulls" for the sake of a more captivating newspaper headline.

It's also probably instructional to stop by your local SPCA and take a look the number of APBTs and APBT crosses represented there.  Many of the dogs that end up at animal shelters were previously abused.  So it's not hard to make the inference that there are a LOT of abused APBTs out there.

I don't mean to suggest that making generalizations (or acting on them) is a bad thing.  It's just a human thing, and one of our most important distinguishing cognitive characteristics.  And it's a useful ability.  But it also gets us into a lot of trouble.  It's what leads to statements like "Muslims like blowing people up" or "Black people are dumb".  We simply need to make sure we think clearly about how we arrive at the generalizations we inevitably make -- and about the consequences of acting on them.
You are absolutely right.  Capitalism is such a stupid idea.  I think the government should just seize all private property, nationalize all industry, and redistribute the profits of all the greedy corporations to all the truly needy people.   We all know that government does a much better job at just about *anything* than private industry.
I think it's to keep non-elected folks from influencing senate work in the chambers. Obviously just outside there are armies of lobbyists, but inside only the elected officials are allowed to use their freedom of speech.

So my take is that Sheehan gets attention for her stunt, but ultimately she knew exactly what she was doing and what the consequences would be.

Indeed, comrade. If only the fat cats would spend less time greedily pursuing evil profits, they could read the history books and see how great our system works.

About fifty years ago people in America misread "all men are created equal" as "all men are equal" (this is a similar mistake as the one made in Russia in 1917 which has led to similar but more ghastly problems outside of America).

One of the things that had to get fixed in order to make everyone equal is to get rid of the word "man" and substitute a gender-neutral word like "person".

Anyway, as a result, if all people are equal, then all points of view must be equal as no point of view exists independently of a person.

If all points of view are the same, then all cultures are the same a culture is nothing but a collective point of view.

The outcome is there is no longer any notion of facts or correctness or best as everything is equal.  There is just a morass of "equality" where, since we can't all be superior, and some of us can't even be mediocre, we all have to be bottom-of-the-barrel together (but don't tell anyone as it may hurt someone's feelings).

Until we are no longer afraid to admit some people are actually are winners and some people are losers (just as some people are taller/shorter, fatter/thinner, smarter/dumber) we will never get back to making progress.

This is obvious as progress implies something is better than something else and better is a word being struck from our vocabulary.

Hi

Forgive me for offering this correction as it does not detract from the point you are making but is only a technicality.

There is no such word as "Bantus". Bantu is already in the plural being the plural of "Muntu". Bantu means people in sub saharan africa (Muntu meaning 1 person). So the Zulus are one of the many Bantu tribes.

No, actually, you don't.  Adams takes false assumptions about evolution, based on ignorance, and runs with them.

I'm not going to spend time go into detail. [Here](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/scott_adams_is_a_wally/) is a decent explanation if you are interested.
How much *terrorism* is working?  Agreed, people are living in fear.  But you're mixing up the causes here: this isn't the media letting the terrorists succeed in their attempts to scare Americans; it's the media (at least, a portion of the media) *actively* attempting to frighten Americans further because it furthers the goals of the current administration.

You're afraid, I'm afraid, and someone out there profits (monetarily or in terms of power/control) by our fear.  This is no different than the transparent ads that try to scare you into buying antibacterial soaps and "air sanitizers" (my god that product is ridiculous) by showing you cartoon bacteria monsters and throwing out phrases like "75 million bacteria living in your toilet!".

An exaggeration? You wish.  The formula is (slahsdot style) (1)find something people are afraid of, (2)verify that people will be hard-pressed to objectively assess whether your cleverly-named product/policy adequately addresses the threat, (3)scare people into buying your cleverly-named product/policy, (4)profit!.

For reference, see also The Clean Air Act, No Child Left Behind, etc.
It seems more like a list of the first lines of a set of 100 books the writer liked. Many lines that lots of people would like on the list are ommitted, and there are also some that don't seem all that interesting or cool when looked at solely on the basis of first-line-ness.
Amusingly, there is another story on the reddit front page rather relevant to your comment -- 
"Greetings from Idiot America" http://www.aboyandhiscomputer.com/Greetings_from_Idiot_America.html

The basic thesis is that "the Gut" has displaced "the mind" in our discourse.

Scott Adams' "point of view" has that Gut quality; it has what Stephen Colbert would call "truthiness".

Translating back to conventional English, that means Scott Adams' post was ignorant and uninformed. But since the Gut now rules, and Scott's musings sound okay to your Gut, his "point of view" is just as valid as the "knowledge" accumulated by millions of scientists over more than a century of research.
Alot of countries have a more socialist outlook than America, you'd do well to not label everything communism. Your play on words are very misleading, countries constantly give things away to the unwashed masses, for example Social welfare assistance, Health care, education.

I don't know enough about Chaves to judge the man, but I see one picture of him coming from the right leaning press, and another from the left leaning press. 

That's to be expected.
Regarding your comment on languages that are "purely X," which seems to be a reference to Haskell, often described as "purely functional," I should point out that Haskell is not limited to purely functional programming paradigms.  It is, for instance, great for imperative programming.

The core language itself is pure but can be used to construct imperative computations naturally using a sequential syntax that will be familiar to imperative programmers.  As a bonus, the type system ensures that you don't accidentally mix imperative bits into computations that you intend to be pure.  So you can be pure and impure in the same program, using each approach where it makes sense, all while being assured that neither side of the program is muddying the other.

For example, implementing a concurrent port scanner is a "real-world" kind of problem that is by its very nature highly impure, and yet it can be solved elegantly in Haskell:

http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2004/03/13/concurrent-port-scanner-in-haskell

In sum, the line between "purely X" and "not purely X" is rather easy to cross, and not as strongly separating as many people seem to believe.

Indeed, politics is perception and if people see a 15 second soundbite on TV showing how Chavez is giving heating oil to poor Americans I think they'll have a positive perception of Chavez even if they are moderates.  That's why Chavez doing this was so brilliant: he's helping people who have been forgotten by their own country and the even though the leaders of that country seem to have it in for him.
In Venezuela the people own the oil resource under their feet - what's wrong with that?  Nobody says they can't make a profit with that resource on the world market (and they are), since that resource is considered part of their national treasure they all get to share in it.  What's wrong with that model?  It's not applicable to everything, of course, but for a natural resource like Oil it's quite applicable and it's a failry commonly held view outside of the US.
This is old news. The journalist might have missed it since it was listed under [SBC](http://www.businessweek.com/@@n34h*IUQu7KtOwgA/magazine/content/05_45/b3958092.htm) when it came up in November. SBC has since bought AT&amp;T and rebranded under that name.

the reason why i think this is good news is because the "india is taking all the tech jobs away from americans" was becoming a serious big-time meme.  whether they actually *were* taking jobs away from americans or not was almost beside the point, but it definitely *was* shaping many people's thinking.  they were all like "dude, we totally have to start off-shoring tech support and grunt-work programming and stuff, to stay competitive!"  but this new development wipes out that argument.  now we know that any country that has cheap tech labor today will become successful enough that they are no longer cheap tomorrow.

I guess my point was that it was idiotic and disprovable to suppose that the private sector somehow managed to exclude incompetence and ineffiency through the magic/sleight of hand of the free market. Regarding railways (and water, gas etc) - they are clear examples of natural monopolies and the only reasons to put them in private hands are ideological/superstitious (or simply corruption - doubtless the real reason imo).
Another example is the Huffman encoding -- it came about in a similar way. Huffman came in late to class, saw a problem on the board which asked for the provably *optimal* lossless data compression algorithm and constructed one, without relying it was a problen his professor was trying (but couldn't solve).

C'mon!
yes, what reddit really needs is for a link bookmarked while using frames to not be made unusable when the submitter deletes it. Its happened to me already.
Even if I did agree with you that T-shirts with slogans should be permitted in the gallery.  The fact that they aren't permitted is *not* an example of severe curbing of free speech in this country.
"In the second century of the Christian era, the Empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilised portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour." - Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776)
I think being thrown in jail for 4 hours is severe.  Perhaps you'd like to try it and report back whether or not you agree.  

There is no prohibition against T-shirts with slogans on them.    That, nitwit, is the point.  The police apologized for tossing her in jail.
You're completely ignoring freedom of the individual. Maybe someone else would be better at making my decisions for me. However, that gives him no right to force me to submit to his will.

Just watch-out for the kool-aid, it's some heady stuff.
Physics lecture? or Social commentary? Only time will tell.
i want a "concept/theme" filter, not a site filter. That may be hard, so a keyword filter might be ok too.

zippit - i cant do it alone. would like more people to do it AND keep it isolated in one place in the UI for quick scanning. at the moment, comments bounce up and down as determined by "time of last post in a thread"
What also seems a bit crappy is 2/5 of the determination of self-discpline is based on a parent and teacher questionaire. I would have thought most parents/teachers think their kids are not self-discplined if they don't get good marks. So its a bit of a circular measure. I bet previous high marks correlate very well with future high marks.
On an entirely personal aside, I'd like to point out that I really appreciate your comments on reddit. I imagine we disagree on many of the various controversial issues, but I never feel that your comments are childish or reactionary.

Reddit doesn't have a space for personal communication, so I'll take this one. I'd google you, but "rah" isn't googleable.
It is a parody of all those pixel-selling sites.
A team of maverick podcasters have developed technology that stitches together MP3s files on the fly, allowing listeners to create dynamic custom taylored episodes.
It would be very interesting to see how site content or even post title relates to mods.  Many sites are using tagging as course categorization on content, and a spider/scraper might be able to come up with a relatively quick way of sorting posts into buckets.  The site itself, technorati, digg, and even del.icio.us would be obvious sources of this information.  I don't know how "bad form" it would be to query your "competitors" for information on a given link, but such sites are designed for querying...  They wouldn't be public otherwise.

The next questions to ask is how do you effectively group tags into more general groups that are suitable for presentation on "new post" sites like this.  You could almost predict how a user would mod based on tags, URL's themselves, and previous performance, which might be a good way to utilize the "recommended" page on this site.

Anyway, enough brain storming for now.
[deleted]
Who better to make your decisions than someone you elect?
Applicable.
Hmm, a thought on modding, buckets, and karma.  Perhaps you have a user, like myself, who enjoys technical articles and tends to mod them up, ignoring the other stuff.  Let's say I see an interesting title on a post that talks about knitting Irish wool sweaters.  I visit it, like it, and mod up the post.  I've effectively participated in modding a set of links I wouldn't normally be concerned with.  Shouldn't that weight the score for that post?  Instead of modding up a point, perhaps it should go up two.  The catch is that it's not my decision how much weight it receives.  So now you have two points of data for the post: mods (up and down), and a weighted score.

Thanks!  I can pay you much the same compliments.

Though we very definitely disagree on many things, I also recall some unexpected points of agreement.  It is most gratifying to note we can be mutually appreciative of one another even despite our sometimes "adversarial" contacts.

Thank you for your encouragement.  Despite my semi-regular disparagement of reddit modding/modders; I actually paranoidly believe I developed a dedicated group of anti-fans who seek out my comments in anticipation of disliking them.  (But unlike you, and other interesting sparring opponents, instead of replying they just mod.)  I believe this not because of any diagnosed (or undiagnosed) medical condition, but because I occasionally find comments of mine downmodded that contain not a shred of opinion, only readily verifiable facts

At any rate: C'est la vie.  I just hope comment modding won't soon start having an impact, because that would (as you probably well know) pretty much remove me from all discussions.

I await with immense curiousity how this comment will be modded in comparison to my other comment, and in comparison to your equally off-topic (though shorter) comment.

"Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you!"
If the situation wasn't so sad, you'd be funny.
Maybe you should move to Zim for a few months, and tell us what it's like afterwards. Lots of wide open spaces there.

Have a look at Nelson Mandela's view on Mugabe:
Mandela expresses anger at Mugabe:
http://www.namibian.com.na/Netstories/2000/May/Africa/007A98DA73.html

Mandela adds to Mugabe pressure
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/739258.stm


COSATU, the largest SA trade union, and part of the ANC alliance are absolutely anti-Mugabe. They recently blocked the border between SA and Zim. Now, I don't know how familiar you are with the political setup in this region, but this should give you some indication of how the workers perceive him.

Have a look at:
Zimbabwe: Lessons for South and Southern Africa
http://www.cosatu.org.za/speeches/2001/zv010214.htm

He confiscated white farms almost as a smoke screen to hide his other attrocities behind.

I think I said this elsewhere, but these days you get a $50,000 bill in Zim. For two reasons: Else you'd need something larger than a wheelbarrow for your cash. And to avoid an arbitrage situation developing with toilet paper - it is literally cheeper to use zim dollars than toilet paper.


as a complement ...(see above), I have a dumbed down thing called linkr8r which works with  ezproxy, databases, and some opacs. http://linkr8r.org/ ..Charles L
I agree - if they were really concerned about democracy and destroying tyranny they would have bombed Mugabe before they bombed Sadam.

If any Western/Eastern leader did what he's done (and forget about the stolen farms) and there would have been international outcries. Had any middle eastern country done it they would have been bombed and invaded (and here I have to exclude Israel, there are "special rules" for them). The fact that it's happening in Africa means that the West can't really give a damn. The only reason anyone in the West knows anything about Mugabe is because of the confiscated white farms. Had it been black farms they wouldn't have given it a second thought. Sad thing is the farm issue is the tip of the ice berg.
**[speakeasy prices](http://www.speakeasy.net/home/compare/)**

Sure they're posted. Basically, $50/mo + activation for the slowest service. $6 premium if you want "onelink", meaning DSL without getting a phone line via your local carrier.

And it's a $30/mo bump to the next speed level, then a $10/mo bump and another $10/mo bump.

Not extremely attractive compared to slightly faster service from your local Bell IF you can keep your bill less than $56. I'd have paid less if I'd gone with speakeasy. SBC always manages to surprise me with the monthly bill.
The first link you posted is practically void of content.  Mandela's opinion is of no consequence to me unless it is well reasoned... and in the article you linked, there really isn't any reasoning.  Sorry--I'm not part of the western Nelson Mandela fan-club... which reminds me too much of the western Dalai Lama fan-club.

The second link points out that on at least one thing, **Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Mandela agree**.  Guess what it is?  The very topic this article is about:

&gt; Mr Mandela backed "equitable" change to land ownership in Zimbabwe, where "50% of the land... is owned by whites".

The last link... god that man goes on and on.  Perhaps you could highlight specific sections of relevance for me?  The general gist of it though is that everything happening in Zimbabwe is terrible.  Well... the general gist of it is that from what reports he receives in South Africa, things are terrible.

Are there any media sources you could direct us to that shed light on events?  Something with more details, instead of just quotes of celebrity Africans?
As a South African I have to absolutely disagree with your views on Mandela. Had it not been for him South Africa would have seen an extremely bloody civl war. All of us owe him our eternal gratitude. I saw the Man in action, I saw the effect he had on white and black alike. He is one of the only true Hero's of the past century. Read "Long Walk to Freedom" by Mandela, and to get a view from the perspective of the then ruling class read "The Afrikaners" by Herman Gilliomee.

Mugabe started off as one of the greatest liberation leaders of his generation. No-one knows why after 20 years of rule he suddenly changed. I would really like to know if there is anything less ego-centric behind his actions.

As for the rest of your post: I think you're trolling.
What **is** happening, BruceWarne??

You keep telling us we know nothing... why don't you make a point form list of the things you attribute to Mugabe.

Here let me start you off (from what I recall):

 * nationalising media outlets
 * silencing political oposition through both non-violent and violent means (although the violent means are not always directly government applied) : *how many alleged victims of violent silencing there are would be relevant to know*
 * confiscation of white farms
 * mishandling of confiscation of white farms
 * causing starvation and other economic suffering through mismanagement of white farm confiscation program

What else?

---

I should mention I very much agree with most of you post... except for the part where you advocate the bombing of Zimbabwe.

But then, I would rather my nation endure yet another century or two of tyrrany (it presently does not face such) than to have barbarians destroy and desecrate the land and material accomplishments of my ancestors (both direct and national).

I do not claim moral superiority, but that is how I feel.
I don't troll.

If we disagree, we disagree.  There are individuals very reverently "worshiped" in my country as well who, on closer examination, are far less worthy than the average person's attitude would suggest.  But maybe Mandela is one of the few genuine heroes of incredible virtue out there.  I don't know.

rah,

sorry to destroy your illusions.
I was in Zimbabwe in 2001 with my brother and his girl-friend, we traveled through Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia) because we wanted to see the eclipse in Zambia.
In Hwange National Park we had our first encounter with Mugabe in the form of a three-meter (10 feet) portrait in the entrance room. This alone disturbed me; which kind of people do really like huge portraits of themselves ?
Anyway, we befriended a camp guard in the National Park. During our stay in Zimbabwe we ran out of gas in Vic Falls and were forced to buy it on the black market (So the crisis on the supply markets was already showing; the Zimbabwe dollar had already a high inflation rate).
We tried to keep in contact and the letters we received are getting worse and worse. No maize meal, no tourists coming, etc. After a year (I sent money in letters, this is not a Western Union land) the contact finally broke because some letters disappeared and Martin wasn't even able to buy stamps.
From my viewpoint the tribal structure in Zimbabwe isn't so much a problem, but I was only one week there.
So my views of Mugabe is quite....negative.

Comrade.  You mean, doubleplusgood, comrade!  ;)
Rah, sorry I have to get some work done here - can we continue this debate later? Google for Mugabe site:za for more info. Or go live there for a while.

Yes, the West only gives attention to the man because of his confiscation of white owned farms. In South Africa however, he gets coverage for what he does to blacks. 

Free press in Zim is all but dead - so unfortunately you can't really expect to get an unbiassed Zimbabwean view on the situation (you'd either get views from zim journalists who have been deported or from those who are working for the government).
You are right.

I modded it up primarily because I think it is fostering interesting discussions.
BruceWarne--I am in no hurry to finish our debate.

I would appreciate though if you stopped telling me to move to Zimbabwe.  We both know it isn't going to happen.  Surely that fact does not preclude me from being able to intelligently reason based on available data.  And the "move to Zimbabwe" comments (as well as some of your other comments) make me wonder whether you are trying to arouse "white man's guilt" in me.

I have no white man's guilt.  As noted in another comment of mine on this page, I find being generalised as a "white man" rather offensive.  My ancestors were not, and my national was not one that participated or benefitted from African exploitation.  I am not beholden to my African neighbours any more than I am to other people the same skin-colour as me; nor am I automatically fraternal toward or prejudiced against either group.

If I misinterpreted you, I apologise; and please do not take it personally.  Just wanted to make sure we are on the same page on this point.

I'll look at some Zimbabwen stuff as I can find it on Google tomorrow.  Hopefully it will provide me with some additional insight. ;-)

Have a good day at work!

Ah but American English was a fully native speaking English community from day 1. The grammar of American and British English is effectively identical. Whereas Indian English was a second language to Indians that basically became a creole language, and is only now being de-creolised. 

The grammar of your average Indian English speaker is considerably different to American and British English. For example "Do you have a pen?" is often said as "You have pen, no?" in Indian English.

well if the intention was to be offensive then they get 10 out of 10.  if it was to be funny then they get 7.
This should give you some more background:
http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/Home/

This is from a program aired in mid-2003. I doubt that 75% of Americans still believe the invasion was a good idea.
If this story had any basis then there would be a class action lawsuit rather than a $20 eBook.
My goodness, what a pompous windbag... you'll need your hip-waders to make it through this mess.
Mugabe and the idiots who voted him into power got what they deserved.  Lets see how long it takes them to beg for food from the colonial powers.   Wait, I forgot, South Africa will probably end up paying for everything again...
I've found the mapper/packer distinction useful for understanding certain types of conflicts, but it's not really black and white.
I'll leave it to other members to attack your racist views.

Just this:
I'm a white South African, and I've been living quite a nice life here under a BLACK government for the past 12 years.

Violent crime is ridiculously high, and AA is applied in a fashion that can definitely be seen as reverse discrimination. But for the rest all is going quite well. I live a better life than my parents ever did. The economic policy is up there with the best. SA's foreign debt has been paid off a long time ago.

If they could get rid of violent crime it would be one of the best places in the world to live. But, alas, it is violent crime and not generally bad/black government that is driving emigration at the moment. 

I also feel that race relations in SA are generally much better than in most places in the US.
Nobody cares. The Nazis are so last century. 

You Nazi-haters need to give it a break. Why not go back to picking on the Caananites for a change?
Those who know what Commodore 64 means remember awesome game called Galaga. Bugatron is a cool 3D remake of Galaga and runs on any PC.  Quite cool.
[deleted]
Whites suffer from violent crime and AA. But most are extremely patriotic. We're a strange bunch down here - the world will never truly understand us. Most people who had problems with the new political setup emigrated 10 years ago. The people who are leaving now are doing so because of the fear of violent crime.

Just before the elections in 1994 a general in the army told a general in the police: "With your men and mine, we could take this country in an afternoon". The other general replied: "Yes, we could. But what do we do tomorrow morning? All the problems will still be there".

A war would have accomplished nothing but delay the inevitable for a few decades. And the generation who would have had to fight that war (my generation) were not prepared to offer themselves on the altar of their grand-parents' idiotic ideas.

Oh, yes, most of the perpetrators of violent crime are not even from SA, but from Rwanda, the Congo, and elsewhere. Ex child soldiers.

How is observing what blacks do racist? Is it not the case that blacks do that stuff? If blacks do that stuff, how is it racist to conclude that blacks tend to reduce societies?

Also, the fact that you've had it good does nothing to dispute the fact that black rule has been hell for millions of people, blacks, whites and coloreds. For the mass of people, but especially whites, it has been a huge loss.

Also, if the government's job is to control crime (and not, say, private industry), how can you but blame the black government for failing to keep things in check? 

You aren't making sense.

I never meant to say you did.  My point is that your post -- "Michelle Malkin's thoughts are unclean!" -- detracts from the debate at large.

"Double Standards In the West" !

What, do you think this is a college application essay or something?  WTF?

**Of Course** there's a double standard in the west.  Westerners are self-interested just like everyone else.  We'll fight for our strategic interests, which means "our best guess about how to preserve our way of life."  Sometimes we're wrong, and it's never very noble, but it's arguably better than any other hegemonic power in human history.

I refer you to my post below: which of those other options would you luminaries have us pursue?
What about all the idiots who stayed home to protest Mugabe's rigging the vote?
" Do remember that defendants are always Mr, Mrs, Miss until convicted, however obvious their guilt and appalling their crimes. ". Who said standards were slipping?
You've just totally mischaracterized the American South.  It's not like that here.  I'd say only about half the population is really unhappy about the 'mestizo invasion', which has been important economically regardless.  Black-on-black crime is much more common than black-on-white crime.  And if the mass media is controlled by an elite that's hostile to the majority, that would make it a lot like plantation farming, wouldn't it?
Maybe he should try [skiing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lincolnshire/4665494.stm)
Who the hell approves of talk like this?  How many accounts do you have, pica?

Even if were true it's off-topic and inflammatory.

CLARIFICATION: I'm trying to say that "Liberals are habitual liars" is a dumb generalization to make.  That's all.
Perhaps the author and all the other "haters" (I love it when ghetto expressions go mainstream) should work on producing something better, instead of just complaining.

In the author's own words (page 18): "Unix survives only because everyone else has done so badly."

Well said.


Pica's point was that the Southerners of long ago would not have given up.

The modern day population is different, and thinks differently. 

The now dead Southerners would not be happy at all to see how things are. The interesting thing about South Africa is that the people who decided to throw in the towel are still alive.


When picking "best lines", there's a choice. You can either pick ones that stand well alone, or ones that are powerful in the context of the story and pretty much meaningless otherwise.

This is one of the more mature, fair comparisons of the uses of the two languages that I have seen here.  The author acknowledges that there are many factors that skew his results, so he accepts that his conclusion can only be that Ruby can be a viable alternative to Java and may, sometimes, be better.

I may give Ruby a try knowing that it has its uses in my field of software development.
I wonder why it was modded down. Was this a less valid contribution than any of the others? Or is there just a Gregg Egan hater in the house.
The [Implicit Association Tests](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/) (which sound like what the article is talking about, though it calls them association tests) are really cool.

True, it's not really black and white.  Still I must admit this was like a bolt from the blue: I was wondering why everyone else in my office was so *stupid*.  By adopting this guy's point of view (that some people pack and others map) I can see that I could view myself as a mapper and most other people in my office as packers - and that they only seemed stupid to me because they don't have really good maps.

Anyway I think the guy uses the terms too early, without really defining them until the end of the first chapter, but if you persist the definition comes out.

Entry about Steve Kubby and Corey Maye
Somewhat sadly, I've had to give up on DSL.  Up until a few years ago, I had a T1 provided by my then-employer (sweeeet), but then they decided they wanted to charge me $200/month for the local loop (not so sweet).  That's pretty cheap for a T1, but not cheap enough to make it a justifiable expense just for the upstream bandwidth and other advantages over DSL or cable.  So I used a cable modem for a few months as a quick fallback, then got DSL.

It was pretty decent.  Only went down a couple of times during the ~3 years we had it, was fast as the T1 on downstream, and we could cope with the upstream well enough that we didn't move our web sites off of our server at home.

But when we moved recently, and the DSL was moved, things went south quick.  For several weeks it didn't work at all.  Then they sent somebody out from Covad and he did some rewiring, and it sort of worked, for a little while (a few days).  Then I started having to reset the modem every day, and it was slowwww when it was up.

Eventually we found out that we were just too far from the CO to get reliable or fast service.  So I relunctly investigated cable modem service.  I found out that our local provider, Charter, has a business service with 3Mbps downstream (twice what we got with DSL) and 384Kbps upstream (same as what we got with DSL), with static IP, that you can run servers on freely, for $75/mo.  And you can get it in your home if you know who and how to ask.

This is not an endorsement, but the service works well enough for me.  I've only been using it for a few months, though.

The point is, though, that the LECs (or at least SBC - now called AT&amp;T again) need to get their acts together if they want to beat out the cable companies.  If they can't provide DSL to somebody living in a house in a very affluent medium-density neighborhood, in a major suburb of a significant city, that is not in any way semi-rural ("out in the boonies"), then they are doing something wrong in my book.

So you are saying that a hybridised capitalist/communist economy is more successful than a purely capitalist one.
Well, I have noticed in my life that once I patiently applied myself to things I had never considered that I could ever be any good at (and had avoided having anything to do with for that reason), I made much more progress than I would have thought possible.

For example, I had never so much as touched a piano until my son and daughter started taking lessons.  So I began helping them with their lessons, doing it with them.  Within a few months, having only practiced a few hours a week, I was playing pieces I would have thought would take me much longer to learn.

I am sure Paul Graham, when he makes assertions like, "they'd get suprisingly far" is drawing on personal experiences in which he tackled a subject out of necessity and was suprised at how far he got in a reasonable time.  I am also pretty sure, in comparing notes with other people, the he noticed he wasn't the only one to notice this.

He then puts the observation in an essay and it resonates with lots of people.

Now, that is hardly a double blind study, if that was what you were looking for, but it isn't as if the only useful things we know are what we learn from double blind studies.

Observing patterns in one's own life and comparing notes with others is, I think, how we learn quite a bit of our practical knowledge.

It's not an either/or thing. If you measure your principles or morals relatively, it's a good indicator that don't have any.
diskspace is cheap, but disk writing time isnt, is it? i was worried that would be the tradeoff. but i'm guessing my bottleneck is my internet connection, not my disk speed or RAM. i tried the program last night and it seems pretty good. works well, good options and it connects for a couple of torrents i was unable to with bitcomet. i'm not sure why that is, but if it works, i wont concern myself with why bitcomet failed. it does seem like i'm connecting with much fewer peers than i did with bitcomet. i probably just need to mess around with the settings.
Been a huge fan of findory for a long time. To this day I think is is the best blog/news recommendation site I have found.
As a thought experiment, I wonder what it would be like if instead of building their own stores, companies like a Starbucks franchised existing coffee houses, helping them cut costs through collective purchasing power of the franchises, helping them manage their books, etc, while still letting the franchisees maintain their own quirky style.  Probably not as much profit to be made that way, but would it be viable nonetheless?

You make some sense, but I think there's a huge difference between personal property (pen, book, car, home), and ownership of the majority of land by a small class of landlords who acquired the land violently in the first place. 
I think the concept that people can own land - maybe apart from a working farm or allotment - is ridiculous. The land has been there millions of years - all of us just pass over it. Except some people try to stop others passing over it.

Has got to be the most useless quote I have seen in an article. Bad enough I had to point it out. The quoted doesnt seem to have any credentials or anything to add. Some redemption in the 2nd page of the article though. 
&gt;"It (was) smart on their part," said Sreenath Sreenivasan, the dean of students at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. "They didn't go after some guy who sold 5,000 copies. They went after a guy who sold 3.5 million copies."
Yes, China has a mixed economy. Unlike Russia which underwent a rapid, shock transition to private ownership. (Sarcasm Warning!) What an economic dynamo they unleashed right?

Russia's economy has contracted pretty much every year since the fall of Communism, and is now smaller than Belgium's.

It would be more energy efficient to have people travel in bulk, but you have to run the trains/buses/whatever all the time so people will pay attention to your system at all.  That means that outside of rush hour, you'll be operating your trains/buses/whatever with very light loads, but at approximately the same cost in energy.  So you have to hope that you make up during peak hours what you lose during the rest of the day, and that only happens in very dense cities with large numbers of people that work bankers' hours.

This is interesting, but it's different from AT&amp;T's desire to charge companies like Google or Vonage directly for the ability to reach the end users of their network unimpeded.

What Verizon is basically saying is that they are implementing QoS for their IPTV service.  They're carving out 80% of their backbone capacity for guaranteed bandwidth that they believe they will need to support that service.  This is not really controversial IMNSHO.  If IPTV usage causes other services to suffer, they'll end up having to adjust or they'll lose customers who need reliable Google access (or whatever).  Cable operators will love this.  WiMax startups will flourish.

So this is interesting for people who are interested in IPTV, network carrier strategies (Verizon's in particular), etc.  But I don't see why Congress should care if Verizon shoots itself in the foot.

I'm no MS fanboy, but one thing IE7 (or Opera) has over Firefox is that there is a new tab button on there by default. I'm not sure mom would know about ctrl+t or customising toolbar. As tabbed browsing is touted as a main feature, the new tab button should be there ... anybody agree?

Yeah, it's OK.
I like much of what he says, but I have some fundamental issues with the mapper/packer distinction as just too simplistic.

The funny thing was when I realized I was a mapper in some areas, but a packer in others. Most people are. The less interested I am in a subject, the less likely I am to expend the energy to create a map.

My curiosity has few limits, but my energy does. If I can "get by" in a subject of which I have no permanent interest by learning just enough by rote to function, I will do so.

Further, packing has its advantages in some cases. Creating a map, at least for me, usually ties into the emotional system - witness a hacker who cringes at ugly code. 

I've seen teachers who can map through the entire theory of teaching, and of their subject, but can't associate concepts on computers. Notice that they love teaching, but have no interest in learning any more than they have to about a computer. This is a conditioned response; in a school system, the teacher who knew their way around a computer ended up with additional (unwanted) responsibilities.

I found mapping and packing as useful constructs of information gathering, but much less useful as a personality trait.
I told you so, the site sells cheap downloadable software.

Umm... maybe I wasn't clear - the fact that some people want to censor some cartoons doesn't make the US a bastion of free speech _simply by comparison_. Principles by definition are not relative. That is nothing to do with seeing the world in black and white terms (quite the opposite).

do they explain anything about the ton of bugs?
You could just, y'know, not post comments dissing every article posted here.  Or, I dunno, make a point every now and then or something.
All the people you listed have a style that makes their writings often come off as The Absolute Truth, true. As a critical thinker, however, it is your job to filter out any biases and extract any useful information and insights. Is that too much to ask?
First let me go on record that, as a libertarian, I have serious problems with much of what Bush has done.  That having been said, the headline is yet another instance of someone making things up for their own purposes.

From the article: "Prime Minister Blair responded that he was: 'solidly with the President and ready to do whatever it took to disarm Saddam.'"

Notice the word "disarm".  You don't talk about disarming someone who you know has no arms.

Also from the article "He [Bush] went on: 'It was also possible that a defector could be brought out who would give a public presentation about Saddam's WMD'".

Clearly, according to the article, Bush and Blair both believed there were WMDs.

Why do people make up things like the headline to the post above?  Is it that they are part of the "loony left" and are desperately hoping if you repeat a lie often enough someone will believe it?  Or is it someone working on the "radical right" putting out postings to make the left look loony?

No matter what is going on, it is harmful to the rest of the world.  Events are hard enough to understand without disinformation being added to the mix.

The author thinks that compressing pages with zlib makes PHP run faster - in fact PHP should run slower (albeit marginally) if zlib compression is enabled.  However, the amount of data transmitted to the client is less, making the load time quicker, provided the PHP code isn't poky.
Personally, I don't have a problem with seeing his blog posts on reddit as long as the posts are interesting and insightful.  I do see how it could get old, though.  Maybe reddit needs a soapbox.reddit.com special-interest site for the Kawasaki/Graham/Spolsky-esque posts.

No, I don't think so, why?
I also have problems with what Bush has done but....

The title of the article is "The White House Memo".  The article goes on to say: "Channel 4 News has seen minutes from that meeting.....".

What is this memo? What are these minutes?  The rest of the article just quotes a book by someone who was not at the supposed meeting, nor are there any claims that the author saw any memos or minutes.

A few reasons why the administration won't roll divisions into Iran anytime soon:
1) Domestically, they couldn't sell it unless an ayatollah was filmed sitting on some newly-made nukes on CNN with a promise to drop them on American cities. Folks may not have noticed, but domestic approval ratings for the president, and in particular, the Iraq war, are quite low.

2) Iraq is a country of about 26m people, and are split into different ethnic groups and religious sects that love to hate each other. Though few want foreign troops to stick around, most were happy to see Saddam brought down. Iran has nearly 3 times the population of Iraq, and are overwhelmingly of one religious sect, and by most reports, a lot more cohesive than Iraq. Occupying Iran would entail numbers of US troops that would dwarf the Iraq numbers. As a preemptive war, it just wouldn't fly politically.

3) Whatever one may think the Bush administration's intent is, they are working for a stable Iraq. Few viable conspiracy theories suggest otherwise. Going into Iran would likely send the *relatively* stable Shiite south of Iraq into a frenzy, and would empower those attempting to destabilize in other regions too. This is also why they will be hesistant to bomb specific sites, or to let Israel do so.

There are many other reasons, but those are the big boys that come to mind. Oh yeah, the Bush administration won't have **any** help for a coalition this time.

I didn't claim the US was a bastion of free speech (in some sort of absolute sense).  According to your statement, if I observe that the situation is far, far, far worse outside the US then I have no principles or morals because I made that comparison?

If you choose to label the Cindy Sheehan incident as 'severe', how to you label
the cartoon incident?  As 'severely severe'?  My original post and subsequent posts were trying to point out that using 'severe' to describe the actions of the Capital Police skews the discussion such that it becomes difficult to make
any kind of distinction because every situation is considered 'severe'.

While I would certainly agree that there are free speech concerns in the United States, the situation can hardly be called severe within the larger global or historical context. Can the situation in the US be improved?  Sure, but it is much, much, much better than most of the rest of the world (including much of Europe).
So is this available in the US?

You guys need to read up a bit on libertarianism, socialism, private property, capitalism, communism, and so on.

It is reasonable to put forth arguments for state ownership but don't pretend that you are not arguing *against* private ownership and individual economic choices  (e.g., Do I want to sell my property or not?).

Take a look at the recent Kelo v. New London decision by the US Supreme Court to get a sense of the various points of view with respect to private property and public interests.

what a bizarre and interesting article, but why are the articles in this magazine so long
Now that's sneaky: posting an article on Reddit that on its turn links to a list Paul Graham and Guy Kawasaki articles... Hmmm...
My hope is that you are right...but
1) Bush's approval ratings can't go a lot lower and remember that he's a lame duck, so who cares, if he furthers the neocons agenda?
2)I don't think it would start out as a war, but as air raids.  The UGLY Iran/Iraq war of the 80's was a stalemate, despite the fact that the US backed Iraq.
3)whether or not they are working towards a stable Iraq, the simple fact is they underestimated what it would take to occupy Iraq for 3 years.

A lot of this article is over-hype right now, but if it gets to the point where Bush decides to do bombing runs of nucular facilities, escalation could follow.

No doubt a drawn-out war in the west of Iran and an escalation of war in Iraq would be awfully profitable for Cheny's friends and you are assuming that we understand all of the neocons' motivations.

It's even easier to track someone's phone than he makes out in the article. You don't even need physical access to a person's phone. If all that person has to do is reply with "LOCATE" or some other canned response, then all someone has to do is use a 'prank' text message provider which allow you to send SMS messages which appear to come from any number you set.

Obviously that person will still receive the original messages from the tracking service, but most of them will probably think it's spam.

Virgin in the UK are the only network not providing tracking data to companies like this. 

Scary stuff.
"The cartoon is clearly offensive to Muslims and should be apologized for." Give me a break, the uproar caused by those cartoons show how the sick and radicalized sections of Islam actually speak for the Muslim world at this moment. How can a cartoon in Denmark cause such a problem? I mean how messed up in the head do you actually have to be to give a crap about something like that.

We have our beliefs, they have theirs. We believe in freedom of press, they don't. If that causes them offence big deal.

Wow, how cool is that!!!!
Could you please explain the concept of "offensive" to me. People seem to use this word to suppress all kinds of things, from sex or violence in games, movies, TV,... to parodies, satire and other political or (anti-)religious content. From my perspective it looks like "offensive" is a term always used when there are no real, objective arguments why something is bad. Usually the content in question is just "bad because our tradition says so" which is not the best argument to have especially when advocating strong measures like censoring of the free press.

Well, years f Usenet and mailing lists have taught me that the path to enlightment is hitting the 'Send' button.  Writing things out, as opposed to simply mulling them over in your head, is a pysical process that seems to inoke different thinking modes.

&gt;half of americans already support war with iran right now, according to a poll released feb 2.

Maybe you took the poll yourself, 'cause I sure couldn't find it anywhere. Provide a link.

&gt;at the very least there is a real possibility israel...will be helping

In gulf war I, the US provided Israel with Patriot missile batteries. The US insisted (begged) Israel not to retaliate when Saddam dropped scuds on them. Saddam hoped to pull them into the war, for that would have made it nearly impossible for the Arab governments in the region to maintain their support. The hatred of Israel is one of the greatest unifying factors in the region. In the current Iraq war, you will find no Israelis around. They would be very helpful, but there was a very conscious decision to keep them out of it. Do your homework.

Also, with respect to a few of the European governemnts that initially contributed troops to the current Iraq war: Spanish government: tossed from office. Italian government: about to be tossed from office. British government: Took major losses in the recent election. Europeans electorate as a whole: More opposed than ever.

&gt; what they want is access to oil, a puppet regime to them is just bonus points

If this is true (I believe it is much more complicated than *just* oil) then they need stability to get oil out. Production in Iraq still has not reached the pre-war output numbers. Besides this, by looking at their actions post-invasion, you can discern that they are working for stability, regardless of the often moronic mistakes they make in attempting to do so.

Democracy is more than just elections. 

Freedom does not mean everyone has to agree. Freedom means that everyone gets to express their opinion. Google on "The bill of no rights" for a bit of satire that might clarify things a little. Specifically:

This country is based on freedom, and that means the freedom for everyone, not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots and probably always will be.

Also check out http://www.verilocation.com/
morality is relative. there are certain things that you would surely find offensive, that i won't attempt to name. i'm not going to defend the controversy around the cartoons, because to me they're just cartoons and i don't care about them or religion. but if you're suggesting that there are no grounds to being 'offended' perhaps you need to revisit your own views of morality and see if there isn't anything that is, or could be, offensive to you. 

as it stands, i am hearing your argument as 'i am normal'. what is taking something too far for you is not ok, what is not that someone else thinks is, has no grounds. you are not normal, or at least are not the measuring device from which to judge the justification for everyone else's sense of right and wrong from. paul graham has an interesting piece of writing titled 'what you can't say', where he discusses the taboos we have in western society now, and how in the future we might find those taboos ridiculous censoring.

&gt; According to your statement, if I observe that the situation is far, far, far worse outside the US then I have no principles or morals because I made that comparison?

Not at all, you used that comparison to make the point that the US was tolerant of free speech. This is a bogus argument imo and it could be used to justify almost anything. You may not find it worrying that somebody is arrested for having a statistic printed on her shirt, but to me it's the sort of thing we would criticise in a country like North Korea. The fact is that the US is seen increasingly as a threat by the rest of the world, partly due to these kinds of incident.
I agree that it does seem a bit simplistic. 
I wonder if maybe the value of making the mapper/packer distinction so strongly comes from that it puts them in such high contrast. Yes, I map and I pack, and here was presented a mapping concept (meta-mapping?) with which to think about it and even a vocabulary with which to discuss it. My map has grown. (Of course, many mappers around here will have thought about these things before, and recognize these concepts)

Mapping appears as a tendency, and one can realize that they have only a small portion of Universe mapped and that they have many flaws in what they do have, i.e. a realistic map of their map. The map is not the territory.

One spends a good deal of their life working so I would hope that one would put a good deal of energy and emotion into engaging with that work, or finding some other type of work more engaging. Not bothering to have a map of prime-time T.V. shows does not make you a packer.

The Programmers' Stone defines packing at one point as "socially conditioned conventional thinking". Certainly conventional thinking can get you through a conventional day, but, being conditioned, it would be difficult to toss it aside to solve a non-conventional problem.

So, to the point, using mapper/packer just to label things or people seems like a packer activity. A mapper can use mapper/packer as a launch-point for thinking about things.

Uhh...my contention is that English could die today as a spoken language and still rank among the most influential languages ever.  It is already one of the most widespread languages in history, and about a quarter of the world speaks it at some level of competence(1).  The demand for english skills in the other 3/4 of the world is very strong, and does not show any signs of subsiding just yet.  It has exerted influence of unprecedented breadth on other languages, a trend which, again, does not show any signs of subsiding just yet.

English is disproportionately the language of science:  about 2/3 of the world's scientific papers are in English.  Latin never had the same distinction, I believe, as it had to share the field with Chinese, Greek and Arabic, and later on, English.  

In the face of this, it would seem useful for you to clarify what would qualify as getting into the big leagues of accomplished languages.

With regard to the blathering, my dismissal comes primarily from his oversimplification summarized in the quote "The only thing that keeps the dollar afloat is that oil is traded exclusively in greenbacks rather than some other currency". Like the motivations behind the Neocon's push for war in Iraq, the reasons behind the U.S. Dollar's strength is much more complicated then oil being primarily traded in dollars. 

That said, I don't think there is any doubt that it derives much of its importance (strength) from being a primary currency used in international commodity transactions. It will hurt the dollar if main producers of oil begin selling their goods in other currencies. 

However, alienating the US is not a good idea for the oil producing nations, particularly since the U.S. is the staunchest oil hog out there, and has long maintained unholy alliances with countries such as Saudi Arabia as long as they play along. These regimes generally need the U.S. consumer more than the U.S. needs them. Europe will turn on oil long before the U.S. will, not to mention, Europe won't lead a military charge in defense of oil producing nations, as the U.S. has (see gulf war I).

I went looking for some links, and spent most of my time reading the plethora of links that concurred with the one you posted. There are good points, and I believe, a bit of merit, however, not enough merit to override the realities of invading or even bombing Iran. I'll continue to look for what I believe to be a more realist link...as soon as I get done reading through the monetary conspiracy theorist libraries of links that are strangely addictive.
That analogy is incorrect.  The situation is closer to this:  you and I agree that the string of written characters "five" represents the number of fingers on a normal human hand, but I think it is pronouced "fiv", while you think it is pronouced "sank".  


I really enjoyed this article. I have been telling everyone I know to do something they love, but they always, and I mean always, don't believe that it is possible. Whether it is my mom being a librarian because she simply loves books, and figures that there is indeed some tough times that will have to be had before the goal is met, or friends who just don't understand how to translate what they love (what they would do  as work without being paid) into a living.

For me, the concept of making money is easy. I am a born entreprenuer, but with all the businesses and ventures I have started, they have always been about money. So yes, I know how to make money. And I do indeed know now after reading this article that you MUST love what you do to get past this 70% barrier I have sufferred from most of my life, except for this brief period when I was in grade 9, living with my father, when I excelled into the 90%+ range, as far as school was concerned. Reflecting now, it was simply because I enjoyed it. And the classes I didn't enjoy at that time, I was in the 70% range. I did it well, because the way you do anything is the way you do everything, but the fact is I did much better by default when I enjoyed what I was doing.

So, find what you love. If you love to read, and love literature, figure out why. Maybe you could write reviews for a living? Startup a website and publish them! If it's cars you love, then look at them and see why you enjoy them.  If its the mechanics, become someone that designs cars for a living. Point is, find what you enjoy to do, right now. And see how you would like to spend every hour doing it - without being paid. Money will find its way to you, as long as you enjoy it.
No doubt things are more complex than his oversimplification. I don't think (hope?) Iran is going to be invaded, however the effects of the new oil bourse on the world economy are interesting to consider.

I'm all for offensive humour but I would say a few of those particular cartoons are pretty creepy. To me they weren't at all funny and very closely resembled anti-Semitic cartoons of the 30's. I think there would rightly be huge uproar in the West if these cartoons had depicted Jews. It is generally accepted (in Europe at least) that freedom of speech doesn't encompass race-hate.

Islam is a religion of peace amongst progressive Muslims. How many they number I don't know. I can't blame them for not wishing to speak out too loudly. Amongst the rest, Islam is a religion of peace in the sense of peace as submission to Allah and to Islamic law, for believers that is, and dhimmitude for non-believers. So, yes, "peace" is misleading in the liberal, Western notion of that word. I think we ought to stop using the expression "religion of peace" with respect to Islam.

What you're saying is true, but my concern isn't with nationality of corporations. My concern is with class and property. If rich people do a good job of owning everything, median living standards could fall while net-human-wealth increases.

We could be stuck with "what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity" while 1% of the population controls the wealth.

that's an uplifting and encouraging thought.  i don't think it would ever work in the real world, though.  the reason big restaurant chains work is that every store gets to share in the benefit from national advertising.  every location has to be as much like the others as possible, because sadly, consumers don't like to be surprised.  not even positive surprises would work, because then the customer would develop an expectation that *every* location would have to be just as good.

One of the most infuriating things in software dev today? Thoughtless meritocracy. 'Hire the smartest 10%.' 'If they're not real hackers, don't let them in the building.' 'If you don't understand closures, you're not a real programmer.'

What happens to the less smart 90% you don't hire? Billions of lines of code are written every year by developers who are just about good enough, who produce software that's just about good enough, that just about does the job. 

So maybe they should be better. Then we need to work to help to make them better, not write them off as unworthy mortals. I can think of half a dozen folk I've worked with who produce good-enough but shabby internal production apps who'd benefit from the rather basic advice in the Irish Dev Network article.

A 'real programmer' is someone who writes programs that are 'really used'. We'd do ourselves a lot of favours by not using it to mean 'exceptional coder', 'master craftsman', 'senior dev', 'guru in the making'...

1. People were offended, so the paper apologised. They didn't self-censor. Apology != self-censorship.

2. The Jyllands Posten had a perfect right to publish the cartoons. Offended Muslims had a perfect right to boycott Danish goods.

3. 'Other major papers, it seems, are cowering out of fear of triggering a boycott and endangering the profits of gummy bears and German coffee filters in Arabic countries.' Possibly; but possibly they're not printing the cartoons because they're not especially good or funny.

This isn't about free press. Censorship of it is about not being allowed to get out the true story to people. This already doesn't really apply to columns as they tend to be fictional, and this this is the *funnies* section fer pete's sake. Don't play it's-my-rights victim.

Because that's not central, especially since such national things don't quite apply the same internationally. I'm rather reminded of tourists that are arrogant enough to not adapt to or even to learn even just the important rules of the country they are in, despite that's how they stand legally, and pretty much morally as well.

But like that doesn't apply to things made somewhere and judged elsewhere. However, these things aren't funny,  aren't constructive criticism, and are in general just... negative, so aren't sensible.

The reaction is bloody large and a little inrealistic, but consider that they may think this is representative of the way 'we westerners' think, just as they may think that all Americans are people who just want to conquer people with different views on life, a thought I myself sometimes entertain. That's not much of a conceptual stretch, even.

And now everyone's turning "look, they're offended by some pointless cartoon that I don't even really get myself" into "See? These are the violent people we need to protect you from." Sure, they're kicking up a large shitstorm about something they could condemn and ignore and that's not helping their case - but it's not like no one else around here is capable of that.

Certainly national advertising campaigns are a typical benifit of franchises that you couldn't have in a model like this.  That could be a drawback.  These franchisees would really only need to advertise in their local communities (and online for 'google local', etc, no doubt), but aren't there other benefits to be had from franchising aside from advertising? And would they still be enough of a benefit to create such a network of restaurants?

Maybe a cooperative is a better model than a franchise.  A series of restaurants pool some of their resources to hire out services they can all use.  But then, I don't know much about cooperatives, so maybe I've got that wrong.

One of the most intelligent comments regarding the Danish cartoon outrage was made by the fromer editor-in-chief of the Jordanian newspaper "Shihan", Jihad Momani:

&gt; "Who hurts Islam more: a foreigner who excels in depicting the Prophet, or a Muslim with an explosive belt who blows himself up at a wedding party?" [(source)](http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=77179)

Mr. Jihad Momani was removed from office immediately after he published this comment and some of the cartoons.  He had to apologize for it since then.

The fact that the same people whos religious feelings react highly sensitive to Danish cartoons remain largely passive when terrorists misuse the name of god to motivate their crimes is not enough discussed in the media.

1. Approval ratings will change chaotically during the runup to such an invasion, which would be logistically impossible to set up without the knowledge of the electorate.

2. Air raids have not lead to war more often than they have lead to war.  See #1 about escalation.

3. No.  They thought the war was over and declared victory when plans for the Baathist insurgency were just getting underway.  Hence the weapons caches all over the country, the large numbers of guerillas with established hiding places, and Saddam's tactic of releasing his entire prison population just as Americans were getting close to Baghdad.

Einstein [supported socialism](http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm), not Communism. He supported socialism because he opposed the kind of bureacratic centralized planning inherent in capitalism, where a few major corporations plan how most of the economy is used. He writes:

&gt; The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?
'The fact that the same people whos religious feelings react highly sensitive to Danish cartoons remain largely passive when terrorists misuse the name of god to motivate their crimes is not enough discussed in the media.'

I don't know what the situation is in the media in Islamic countries, but in the UK and US media this point is made constantly on radio phone-ins, TV discussion programmes, the editorials and columns of major newspapers and most other high-profile current affairs contexts I can think of.

It's a correct and well-made point, of course. But if there's a liberal conspiracy to deny this point, it's a very poorly implemented one.

The same would apply to those Muslims living in Denmark. They need to adapt to their adopted homeland, and become Danes.  That means dealing with the fact that Denmark is a liberal, constitutional monarchy that guarantees everyone the right to speak their minds.  If that means that someone is going to make fun of Muhammed, then the Danish Muslims can complain, they can demonstrate, or they can go piss up a rope, but they do not have the right to demand that no one can mock their religion.  

And I have something of an interest in this, since mocking religion is one of my favourite pastimes.

Yeah, and the great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from. Don't forget about all the dead "standards", too. It's one thing to bless and rubber stamp some obscure specification as "standard". It's quite another thing for it to be effectively "standard" by the familiar concept of the adjective, that is, widely accepted, deployed, and understood.

'so I guess fascism and communism are OK, because totalitarianism can't be held responsible for the people who actually implement it.'

False analogy. Most fascist and communists regimes are oppressive and unpleasant. Most Muslims aren't suicide bombers. Otherwise there'd be a lot fewer tall buildings and a lot more holes in the ground.

from the picture on the guy's website I think he is the sad-loner type.
This is not the first time Feynman has had to deal with the Washington bureaucracy.  There is an interesting exchange of letters that his daughter Michelle Feynman collected in "Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track" (ISBN  0-7382-0636-9), concerning an invitation he'd received from the Soviet Academy of Sciences to attend a physics conference in Moscow.  Feynman wrote to both the State Department and the Atomic Energy Commission for advice.  

After some crossed communications, both agencies told him that it would not be wise to go to the USSR, especially since Feynman had worked on the Manhatten Project and had knowledge of matters that were still classified.  Feynman agreed, and sent his regrets.  He did have a small regret about not going, for he missed a chance to meet Lev Landau, who was in many ways Feynman's equal.
Maybe the US State Dept will apologize to Bin Laden for the construction of the WTC.
Yet many people don't do this, unfortunately.
*They weren't trying to censor cartoons and they certainly aren't "in the business" of reprimanding cartoonists! It's a bad headline with the specific intention of misleading the reader.*

Firstly, the headline doesn't say that they were trying to censor the cartoonist, nor does it imply that, so I'm not sure why you're using that as evidence that the headline is misleading.

Secondly, they most certainly were reprimanding the cartoonist.  I suggest you look up the word "reprimand" if you honestly disagree.

Thirdly, "in the business of" is a commonly used phrase merely indicating the concept of "doing".  No reasonable person with a native understanding of English would interpret it literally, as used in the headline.

Fourthly, and most importantly, yes, the Joint Chiefs are entitled to their opinion, and to expressing it, but *no* they should absolutely not be expressing their personal political opinion in their official capacity as the heads of the military, especially in an attempt to put a chilling effect on criticism of the government.  This wasn't merely "I'm a guy and I think what you said is wrong" - this was the heads of the most powerful military on earth, explicitly calling attention to the fact that they are such and explicitly speaking in their official capacity as such, criticizing a political opinion.  If you think that the claim is that the problem with that is a legal one, you are *sadly* mistaken.

"...clearly Americans don't want muslims (or folks with turbans on their heads) in our country."

I hope you're disagreeing with this statement... it's hard to tell from your post.

There are few ways to reveal one's bigotry more clearly than by delineating between "Americans" and a particular racial or ethnic group.  Arab Muslims can be and are (in many cases) American citizens.  Being an American has nothing to do with your race, your religion, your ethnicity, your nation of birth, or the language you speak.  It has nothing to do with whether you wear a turban.

While I agree that the US shouldn't be coming out against free speech on this matter, I don't really expect much from Bush these days.  He will do (has done) quite a bit more than this to keep the Saudis happy, I'd wager.

Smarter people may ask questions, but I seem to remember the idiots that ask questions more easily. This woman I work with - my boss handed her a self-evaluation. Boss said, "Complete this so we can discuss it during your appraisal." After about five minutes, the coworker asks, "So who is supposed to fill out this evaluation? Can anyone do it?" 

I said, "Here. You give it to me. I'll fill out your SELF-EVAL. Are you kidding me?"

And I think displaying the exact ratings on both submissions and comments is one of reddit's best aspects.  Sites which hide what's going on from the user in the name of simplicity or usability or something are making a big mistake; in my view, the more information, the better.

Plus I quite like the idea that people are 'rewarded' as much for coming up with an interesting title as they are for finding a worthwhile link.  I mean, if your link is good enough, it will be voted up anyway, but a title can really help an otherwise decent, but not brilliant, link to get votes.  It's kind've like charisma in real life.
You take great care to disguise your bigotry in these and other posts. You say you are just quoting the majority, but your lack of opposition to it is interpreted as support. Just because its what the majority wants, does not make it the right thing:

I would say that they sympathize with those notions.

When you have people singing pop music about killing Jews and children being taught by their elders the Usama bin Laden is a hero and that if you die while killing infidels you'll get 72 virgins when you go to Heaven, then you are seeing a culture of hate and death. 

Why is it that thousands of people will show up to a town square to scream for the death of Americans because someone put a Koran in a toilet?  I'm sure that there have been people who've torn off pages of the New Testament and used them to wipe their bottoms, but Jerry Falwell doesn't go on TV and tell his followers to kill them.

We are dealing with a culture in which the agenda is being set by bloody-minded perverts who can count on the ignorance and bigotry of their followers.  That is why I can say with absolute confidence that "the majority of this enormous number of people are threatening unbelievers and encouraging suicide bombing".

I'll give it a try. The wasp evolved this behavior in order to ensure easier reproduction. It was probably a cockroach eating wasp that already went for the head to kill quickly. Then by a freak accident a wasp was genetically predisposed to zombifiying and then laying eggs inside the roach. Then later on the behavior evolved where the wasp's offspring would have a better change of survival if the wasp managed to control where the roach went to avoid predators. Over time, predators killed all the population of that type of wasps without that behavior and voila.

"Most fascist and communists regimes are oppressive and unpleasant."

Indeed. And by saying "an idea is not responsible for [its] followers", one is saying that the value of an idea is irrespective of the people who implement it. Thus restricting civil and property rights and treating "political criminals" like chattel, as the canons of fascism and communism profess, is *not* considered the source for totalitarians rounding people up into cattle cars and shipping them to Siberia or Auschwitz. Sorry, I *don't* buy that.

Oh and incidentally, you yourself use a false analogy in suggesting that most muslims aren't suicide bombers, which is true enough, but beside the point. And while we're beside the point, I'll note that while people (often rightfully) criticize christian fundamentalists for being extremists, a caricature of jesus results in a far smaller percentage of adherents chanting "death to [country of origin of caricature]". That most of the Middle Eastern/European Muslims are protesting and burning flags in the streets over some crude drawings speaks very ill of Islam in general, no matter how many of those protestors would actually *kill* someone.

Pica, the founding fathers were very careful in crafting our nation to explicitly *not* let the majority opinion decide how decisions were made.  Our system is a Republic, a representative democracy, not a pure democracy.  If they wanted a pure democracy they would not have limited who could vote, and restricted what they could vote for.  Our founding fathers were familiar with history and knew about the failures of Athens and Rome, and tried to build a system that would be safer from the corrupting forces of power and the mob.

In your post above you yourself appear to hold two contradictory positions - that the mob should rule, and that the (the Constitution) law should.  Those two never jibe.  There have been plenty of cases where the majority of Americans are poorly educated enough that they want unconstitutional things enacted.  Fortuntely our founding fathers were much more subtle then you in their analysis of how to make a government and run it, so they rejected mob rule, and embraced the rule of law.

The internments were not just morally wrong, they were actally unconstitutional, which is why we paid (inadequate) reparations.  Side note - I have (distant) family that lost several hundred acres of farmland in southern California, which the government then resold while they were interned.  That land is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  My family members and their close kin got nothing.  They were American citizens, they paid their taxes, and were as supportive of the war as anyone else, but they were put in a camp, and had everything stolen from them because of the color of theis skin.  We should all do what we can to prevent that kind of anti-American activity from occuring again.

""Alright, that's it. We are detaining all muslims until we can somehow expel them, via a constitutional amendment if necessary,"

I have some questions about this.

Can you tell who is a Muslim by looking at them?

Can you tell who is a Muslim by DNA-testing them?

If a Muslim rejected their religion, in this ethnic cleansing scenario, would she be released from the camps?

If a Muslim wore a green star and agreed to have all his communications monitored, would he be released from the camps?

Would children of Muslim parents also be interned in the detention camps, or would they be separated from their parents?

Would you have to be a practising Muslim, or would coming from an Arab-American family and attending mosque occasionally do?

If you think the 'majority' of Americans would be in favour of a policy of mass detention without trial and religious persecution - would you describe their opinion as 'completely bugfuck'?


'When you have people singing pop music about killing Jews and children being taught by their elders the Usama bin Laden is a hero and that if you die while killing infidels you'll get 72 virgins when you go to Heaven, then you are seeing a culture of hate and death.'

I think you're describing Palestine and Iran - highly publicised and exceptional cases in the Middle East. You may be aware that less than 20% of Muslims live in the Middle East. These pathologies aren't exactly common in Russia, India, France or the UK.

'I can say with absolute confidence that "the majority of this enormous number of people are threatening unbelievers and encouraging suicide bombing".

Could you give some evidence that the majority of Muslims in countries outside the Middle East - the other 80%+ - are doing this?
It doesn't work for states with a single, at-large, representative like Wyoming, Montana, North or South Dakota.

&gt; All the hype surrounding polyphasic sleep can be delegated to the same lunatic basket as miracle diets, scientology, homeopathy, water magnetizers, creation "science", electrolytic detoxifiers, [...]

I think the good doctor has spoken too hastily, considering the growing number of people who have managed to sustain polyphasic sleep (of the uberman kind) for long periods of time (e.g. http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/02/polyphasic-mutants/ but also several people on the uberman Yahoo group).

Coming to this space: comments on the importance of picking a good headline.
I find it amusing how creationists see this and think, "Haha! No WAY something like this evolved from random chance! This is the final nail in the coffin for evolution!"

After all, this is a joke compared to evolution's grandest achievement, the most complex known object in the universe, that thinking lump of 100 billion interconnected units, the *human brain*. Why not use that as your argument instead?

Oh yeah - I forgot your only argument is "WHOA THAT LOOKS COMPLICATED". People find it easier to believe in the evolution of a big homogeneous lump like the brain than of a complex behaviour. Creationists' arguments are almost always predicated on mistaken gut feelings like that.
Some of these are so prevalent in comment pages, you could almost call the post a duplicate.
Freedom of speech allows a person the ability to express themself, but does not (and should not) protect them from having their "expression" challenged by others, even by the government.

I don't completely agree with Higgins' statement, "[Freedom of the press] must be coupled with press responsibility", but it is far from calling for a censorship of the media that many of these comments seem to imply.
Wow, what a horrible, horrible article. If those intangibles would really be so valuable and productive, then why is the trade balance so much in the red? And why are people living on borrowed money?

whoah!  she's hot.
Frankly, this seems like a simple and rather rational response to me. No one is claiming the cartoons were or should have been illegal. For the sake of tolerance and good taste, however, they *never* should've been published. And in this case, the publisher deserves every bit of chastisement they get. They should be ashamed for their editorial irresponsibility

Yes, Monty Python makes fun of christianity. And, that does offend some people. But, it also comes as a predominantly christian culture making fun of itself, and so it's largely well taken. It would be quite another thing if they made fun of muslims, buddhists, hindus, or jews -- the "other".

I'm waiting for an article about water being wet to mod up.
QUESTION: Yes? Can you say anything about a U.S. response or a U.S. reaction to this uproar in Europe over the Prophet Muhammad pictures? Do you have any reaction to it? Are you concerned that the violence is going to spread and make everything just --

MR. MCCORMACK: I haven't seen any -- first of all, this is matter of fact. I haven't seen it. I have seen a lot of protests. I've seen a great deal of distress expressed by Muslims across the globe. The Muslims around the world have expressed the fact that they are outraged and that they take great offense at the images that were printed in the Danish newspaper, as well as in other newspapers around the world.

Our response is to say that while we certainly don't agree with, support, or in some cases, we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world, we, at the same time, defend the right of those individuals to express their views. For us, freedom of expression is at the core of our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. That said, there are other aspects to democracy, our democracy -- democracies around the world -- and that is to promote understanding, to promote respect for minority rights, to try to appreciate the differences that may exist among us.

We believe, for example in our country, that people from different religious backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds, national backgrounds add to our strength as a country. And it is important to recognize and appreciate those differences. And it is also important to protect the rights of individuals and the media to express a point of view concerning various subjects. So while we share the offense that Muslims have taken at these images, we at the same time vigorously defend the right of individuals to express points of view. We may -- like I said, we may not agree with those points of view, we may condemn those points of view but we respect and emphasize the importance that those individuals have the right to express those points of view.

For example -- and on the particular cartoon that was published -- I know the Prime Minister of Denmark has talked about his, I know that the newspaper that originally printed it has apologized, so they have addressed this particular issue. So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images.

QUESTION: That the Muslims speak out with equal vigor when they see -- that's what you're asking?

MR. MCCORMACK: We would -- we believe that it is an important principle that peoples around the world encourage dialogue, not violence; dialogue, not misunderstanding and that when you see an image that is offensive to another particular group, to speak out against that. Anti-Muslim images are as unacceptable as anti-Semitic images, as anti-Christian images or any other religious belief. We have to remember and respect the deeply held beliefs of those who have different beliefs from us. But it is important that we also support the rights of individuals to express their freely held views.

QUESTION: So basically you're just hoping that it doesn't -- I'm sorry I misspoke when I said there was violence, I meant uproar. Your bottom line is that both sides have the right to do exactly as they're doing and you just hope it doesn't get worse?

MR. MCCORMACK: Well, I --

QUESTION: You just hope it doesn't escalate.

MR. MCCORMACK: I gave a pretty long answer, so --

QUESTION: You did. I'm trying to sum it up for you. (Laughter.)

MR. MCCORMACK: Yeah. Sure.

QUESTION: A couple of years ago, I think it was a couple of years ago when, I think it was the Syrians and the Lebanese were introducing this documentary about the Jews -- or it was the Egyptians -- this Administration spoke out very strongly about that and called it offensive, said it was --

MR. MCCORMACK: I just said that the images were offensive; we found them offensive.

QUESTION: Well, no you said that you understand that the Muslims found them offensive, but --

MR. MCCORMACK: I'm saying now, we find them offensive. And we certainly understand why Muslims would find these images offensive.

Yes.

QUESTION: One word is puzzling me in this, Sean, and that's the use of the word "unacceptable" and "not acceptable," exactly what that implies. I mean, it's not quite obvious that you find the images offensive. When you say "unacceptable," it applies some sort of action against the people who perpetrate those images.

MR. MCCORMACK: No. I think I made it very clear that our defense of freedom of expression and the ability of individuals and media organizations to engage in free expression is forthright and it is strong, you know. This is -- our First Amendment rights, the freedom of expression, are some of the most strongly held and dearly held views that we have here in America. And certainly nothing that I said, I would hope, would imply any diminution of that support.

QUESTION: It's just the one word "unacceptable," I'm just wondering if that implied any action, you know. But it doesn't you say?

MR. MCCORMACK: No.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR. MCCORMACK: Yes.

QUESTION: Do you caution America media against publishing those cartoons?

MR. MCCORMACK: That's for you and your editors to decide, and that's not for the government. We don't own the printing presses.

QUESTION: Sean, these cartoons first surfaced in late September and it's following this recent election with the Palestinian Authority. The EU mission was attacked or held, in effect, by Hamas yesterday near Gaza City. And the tact of some of these European newspapers, again, are to re-publish -- these cartoons. Is the election mood -- is this what is possibly fueling this and what is our media response to this, a la, what Katherine Hughes may or may not do versus international State Department and government media to the Muslim world, including Indonesia, Asia, and the Middle East?

MR. MCCORMACK: I don't think your colleagues really want me to repeat the long answer that I gave to Teri, so I'd refer you to that answer.
"The government has always insisted military action was used as a last resort against Saddam Hussein's regime."

This "last resort" claim made it so infuriating to read news in the lead up to the war. As a "last resort," the administration insisted that Iraq produce a report detailing all of its weapons and weapons programs. This would be the only way for Iraq to avoid war. Iraq complied, but when the report failed to include any indication of WMDs, the administration used that as "proof" that Iraq was not cooperating, and that war was necessary.

Obviously the report would have served as proof that war was necessary regardless of what was in it. This kind of stuff pisses me off, and no one even pays attention or holds politicians accountable (except, apparently, in the UK).
I think I see a nipple there.
Some earlier attempts today tried to do just that. Corante couldn't handle the load and boing boing could.
If you could create anything you wanted, why not?
I wonder what the policy on racist or sexist cartoons are for American newspapers?
These things are not illegal nor should be, or are called for to be, but people seem to whine as if they were. They were, however, in bad taste by just portraying negatively and having no point in the process.

The paper was probably right in saying "Okay, that was a little much, sorry about that" and this state department was probably right in saying "Yeah, that was disrespecful without any point."

Because it was, and that's most of the point. By not making a point it becomes a thing indicating prejudice, not criticism. Even charicaturing stupid stereotypes. 

It's not directly related freedom of the press, freedom of speech, nor surpression of truth. This is the funnies section, mild conjecture at best and inherently simplification - sort of risky in any case. It is not a report of an event that is under threat of having its truth surpressed, and no one threatened the Danish to stop this or -bloody-else. At least, "We call for tolerance" does not sound like that to me - but apparently it does to some.

Maybe they should have been ignored, condemned. Yes, the response was over the top, but that's how offense can work - perhaps how it usually does work.

There is a large difference: That was meant in fairly good faith, as constructive criticism mixed with some deconstruction of some ideas that probably deserve a good lookinh at, --and obviously humour. It's done in relatively good taste. So is, for example, Dogma, which pokes plenty of fun at Christianity, but does so with fair respect and clearly more knowledge of what it is criticising that most viewers have, and doesn't charicature much beyond the need of condensation into actual characters.

The cartoon has just faith that it wouldn't stir up a shitstorm. Not necessarily bad, but it's hardly comparable in any way.

That is unrelated to I said (and a little moot). Many ideas are arguable against, however, people are held responsible for their actions, not their ideas. That's how morality and legal issues work.

I see your quarrel with my argument, but it just doesn't make much sense in the end. It's like calling religion hateful because there are quite a few fundamentalists to every major religion, including Christianity, Islam and more. On the whole and at the core, neither approve in any real way of this polarized crap that has been happening as of late. We should remember that.

Yes, and that makes them the violators. Eh, it's an abstract point anyway... Not so imporant, actually. I was just trying to point out it's just too convenient to blame a large group just because you don't know many details. It's actually damn arrogant when it's a stupid overgeneralisation, akin to me denouncing *any and all* Americans because their current govenment is doing some rather questionable things. It would be stupid, and it would be about the same thing.

Usually it is by far the minority that encourages strong violence, and it is the bulk that buys into that it is necessary. I guess you have a fair share of the opinions of that bulk - the bulk on this side, anyhow.

No, it's not one of peace, but that's not the point. Thing is, the largest part of the small group of people with *real* antagonism, that to the point of action, are those against control, occupation - specifically those that *are* being controlled. And what's more annoying for some people to hear, they have some point. Yes, they're going about it badly, but so has America recently, which in some way goes to skew suggestions about intention. To play 'eye for and eye' purely in the realm of the blame game is just trying to rationalize shit.

But I'm getting annoyed now and that's not doing my writing any good. G'night all.
Yes. I realized it shortly aafter I posted. I'd fix it if I could. Sorry.
Actually, need... No, that's a bit too strong. It's a continually debated question whether immigrants should be *forced* to abandon all their values, since that inherently means some degree of saying "your culture sucks. Ours rules. Do it or else we kick you back out" 

Yes, they should definitely keep to laws, know how societry and the system of morality of everyone around them works, speak the language, and such things. But beyond that, requiring much would be assimilation that is often not warranted for any real reasons and is a form of arrogance as well.

No, they cannot demand no one can mock their religion, but that is a nation-agnostic, nationality-agnostic, and just a basic moral point. If you're going to mock people publicly and on a large scale, do it with a point and carefully. That didn't happen in this case, and it's that that I primarily mind. 
But it seems people here have a like to polarize, and that means I get grouped into haters of freedom instead of people questioning extreme points made - generally quantizing the discussion into very twitchy directions. **sigh**

Well, to be fair the article says that Greg began using Python "after he saw an early demo of what eventually became Zope." It doesn't advocate Zope directly.

I'll probably look into Zope 3 eventually to see if it fixes things. But for now I'm really having fun with TurboGears and Django.

The reason I posted this article is _not_ to say 'How dare the Arabs complain about the Danish cartoons when they are producing this kind of stuff themselves'. I thought that on seeing these pieces and understanding some of the background to the imagery, it would be clear to even the densest nitwit that this kind of expression of race hate is unacceptable, no matter who it refers to.

Unfortunately for ID people, no one has been able to demonstrate that something was irreducibly complex.  I don't see how could prove such a thing.

This doesn't bother ID people too much though since the they are not advancing a scientific explanation anyway.

I also threw out my TV in 1995. Believe me people, you don't need it. Nowadays you don't even need it to watch movies. Go rent a DVD and put it into the computer instead.

The reason I threw out my TV was that I was a total TV addict. I could spend endless hours vegetating in front of the TV. Now I spend my time reading, listening to music, programming and what-have-you. I can really recommend it!
"You can't have it both ways."

On the contrary, you have to have it both ways.  If the government makes pro Muslim publicity stunts like this they get more room to maoueuvre when invading Muslim countries.  It makes it slightly harder for the cries of "this is a war against Islam" to stick.

Asking questions is an obvious thing that many smart people fail to do, but something his article did not go into more depth about is why smart people don't ask questions. This is a problem in our educational system: We are taught to know the right answer and not to think our way to the solution.

There was an article a couple days ago about a teacher using the Socratic method to teach students binary math. I believe we could become much more productive as a society if our children were introduced to subjects by asking thoughtful questions that lead their minds in the correct direction for the topic.
I haven't watched tv for a long time, becouse everything what they spit out is pretty unuseful and annoying. Buy this and buy that.. blah...
I've read one article about brains and how they act when you watch tv.. they're passive compared to situation when you're reading something. Funny is'nt it.

As I see it, I think in many cases, it's useless to give up television.  If you're like me and you do happen to ponder the idea of giving up television, you'd most likely replace it with something as equally time consuming and pointless i.e. the Internet.  I think I'm going to take the opposite extreme, I'm going to combine all of those time wasting, pointless activities and do them all at the same time.  God bless multi-tasking, that evolution provided us.  That's right, television, IM'ing, internet surfing, video games, music listening, e-mail checking, cell phone talking, and cell phone texting.  Hedonism at it's best. Screw being a productive member of society.

Its liberating not to schedule your life around TV. Of course now there is Tivo, but I wonder if that makes it worse for people since now they have more shows they **have** to watch, but no excuse to limit their choices.
One of the most pernicious effects of the television, in my humble opinion, is the extremely short snippets it operates in.  They shorten my attention span, and somehow, that really tends to make me unhappy, perhaps because my mind just starts flickering around in an evolutionary "what's wrong?" kind of manner.  The rapidly changing pace of the flickering screen is really disturbing if you're more used to things like reading books.
The author has a point, but I don't see it as a problem of Islam, the problem is with the general concept of religion. It just surfaces more obviously in the countries where religion does have more influence.

that's what I keep telling my boner.
Violence is a common reaction of fundamentalists, whatever their religion.  There are a lot of fundamentalist Muslims for various reasons, but in part because it is the policies of the United States since the 1950's, as we promoted Islamic fundamentalism as an ideological tool to use against both progressive nationalism and communism.  We originally promoted a very extremist reactionary form of Islam in Saudi Arabia to help foil communism and nationalism.  We trained the Taliban in Afghanistan to serve as a foil to the Soviets.  We even trained Osama Bin Laden himself and supplied him with money.  After the Cold War ended, the ideologies we were providing a foil against essentially disappeared, and fundamentalism filled the vacuum, much to our dismay.  I am not saying other factors were not involved, I am just saying that we helped to create the sorceror's apprentice that has now gone out of control.

Fundamentalist Christians do not use violence as much an Muslims right now, thanks in no small part to the efffectiveness of our Western societies in maintaiing a respect for the rule of law, and a tend of promoting liberal democracy that finds violence abhorrent.  All the same, Christians in the US have in the name of religion blown up abortion clinics, murdered abortion providers, murdered gays, and threatened violence againt those whom they disagree with.  The extremists in the Christina Identity movement in the US have killed police officers, committed bombings, plotted a number of terrorist attacks (fortunately virtually all were foiled by the FBI), and committed many hate crimes.  They just don't get a lot of news coverage by the 'liberal' media. In the US politicians are courting them and promoting policies that help them grow, and thanks to Bush we are funding their programs.  

Going into speculation land, I expect that there will be a breaking point at some point when there is a lot of tension in our society, for instance when fosil fuel becomes scarce or when environmental changes become more sever, where fundamentalists in the US that will take even more control, and their violence will grow.
You're saying that creationists jump on this because it seems a lot more "irreducible" than the human brain. In other words, it is easy to see a slightly dumber brain being useful, than to see a slightly worse roach brain surgery being useful.

Rubbish. You're just not being very creative.

You know how a slightly worse roach brain surgery is useful? For immobilizing the roach, while keeping it alive so that the larvae can enjoy its warm entrails. Even if you can't move the roach where you want it to be, this is still pretty good.

You know an even worse roach brain surgery is useful? For killing the friggin' roach!

Delete your incredulity from your mind. These things only seem incredible because we can't understand millions of years multiplied by billions of cockroaches and wasps, each of which was a novel evolutionary experiment. *We just can't.*

As a side note, the article makes this brain surgery appear much more incredible than it really is. It's not some delicate microsurgery that directly modifies the "escape reflex" - it's shooting a venom into the brain to destroy a whole chunk of it, resulting in a mostly docile being. If you've read about lobotomies, you'll know that those resulted in mostly dull, docile human beings. And that's jamming an icepick into the frontal lobe!

My thoughts exactly. I had read somewhere that the guy did test it on his finger, and I was hoping their website had that video. No such luck.

There's probably a disclaimer, "SawStop only works on frozen hotdogs. We are not responsible for any injuries occured while using SawStop."
I would highly recommend this to everyone. I myself, have not watched television on anything even remotely like regular basis for roughly three-four years now. 

I still watch a few shows occasionally -- but not television, rather via downloading them through a peer-to-peer network. The end result is that I have a lot more time in this world: I can watch the shows I like on my terms (e.g.: when I want, not when they're "on") -- thus I am not bound to any external schedule, I do not have to waste time watching commercials and I only follow shows that are critically acclaimed (and not whatever junk I happen to surf by).

The internet beats television for news (and entertainment).
However those cartoons make hypocrites of Arabs who say we should not offend religions.
I suspect blood in a marketing video isn't going to help sell power tools.
There are pro-violent and pro-pacific pieces in the Bible. I'm sure the same can be said for the Koran. Violent people will use whatever they can to justify their actions or to convert others to violence.
As I already said in another thread.

Koran is the literal word of Allah. The word of god is unquestionable.
Bible was written by humans. Hence it can be questioned and re-interpreted.

This makes **a lot** of difference.
I haven't watched television in 10 years, but ever since then I've simply surfed the Web instead... I'm debating whether I've gotten anything out of that.

"I'm sure the same can be said for the Koran. "

Can anyone offer links to support this?  Any quotes from the Koran along the lines of, "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you [...]"?


"Koran is the literal word of Allah."

So you say.  What if I said that Muhammed made it all up, or that he saw and heard what he said he saw and heard, but it was because he was stoned?  We don't really know if the Koran is the true word of Allah, because we only have Muhammed's word that it is, and he's been dead for more than a thousand years.  

It's in the same category as the Book of Mormon: Joseph Smith said he was given some golden plates by an angel that had God's word written in some incomprehensable language.  In order to read them, he needed to put them inside a hat and look at them with a special stone. There's a great episode of "South Park" about it ("All About Mormons") that everyone should check out.

As late as the 19th century, the Koran was open to interpretation, too. Averroes wrote a famous treatise about Islam and science where he said that if the Koran appeared to conflict with a scientific fact, then the common interpretation of the Koran must be wrong.

I don't understand how it works today.
Yep, just buy a DVR and you are game.
I am not a Christian or a Muslim, and regard both as mythological world views from long ago that were successful because of their justification to systematically reject and wipe out other mythologies.  

Both the Bible and the Koran have passages that can be used to justify violence.  "I come not to  bring Peace but a sword."  In the epistles in the N.T., they describe killing an early Christian for charging interest on a loan.  The Old Testament contains many bloodbaths perpetrated by the protagonists, with Yaweh egging on the slaughter, and rebuking those who show mercy or compassion, since his described goal is for the Israelites to conquer various lands he decreed to them and slaughter any who stand in the way.  

But both the Bible and the Koran have passages that can be used to show that they are a religion of peace, you have cited some for the bible.  In the Koran there are many  peaceful and tolerant verses, easily Googled.  The idea of Jihad is presented as the struggle within oneself to overcome one's baser passions.

Both books are awash with contradictions and inconsistencies, which is a real problem.  You can show that the Bible or Koran teach peach and tolerance, but you can also show that they teach intolerance and rabid zeal in attacking those who do not believe as you do.

Fundamentalists despite claiming that their book is dictated by God, and is absolute truth, never read their religious books seriously or critically.  They always pick and choose passages that justify their views.  Whatever their religion, fundamentalists foment in their followers fear, alienation, and anger, and in their more extreme forms teach that extremism and violence in the name of religion are right.
There was a good article about this technology and the challenges the creator has faced in bringing it to market in Inc. Magazine last year:

"He Took On the Whole Power-Tool Industry"
http://www.inc.com/magazine/20050701/disruptor-gass.html

"Gass heard something different. To his ears, Lanier's message was this: If we all stick together and don't license this product, the industry can argue that everybody rejected it so it obviously wasn't viable, thereby limiting any legal liability the industry might face as a result of the new technology. (Lanier denies this was his point.)

Gass was stunned."
How hard is it to give up a 19" TV?  But I guess the 13" one is better if you're going to be watching in a closet - especially if you also have to get a DVD and VCR player in there.
Actually TiVo can make it worse, since then you will always have something available that you want to watch.  My advisor used to say "wouldn't it be terrible if TV was actually good?"  and DVRs have made his nightmare come true.
&gt; the author is pro-Jew

Would you prefer he was anti-Jew?
Don't stop with the Book of Mormon and the Koran; What about the New Testament and the Hebrew bible? 

The bible as we know it went through many changes before the first protestant religion even popped up. Councils of old Catholics, fat off the selling of indulgences, voted on what books should be in and what shouldn't. Hell, some of what became obscure apocrypha is probably there because certain contingents of Bishops had food poisoning that day, though I'm sure God guided it all with an unseen hand.....

Oh, and one quick question. How come God doesn't send colorful miracle-working prophets anymore? And why did they  have a penchant for showing up in times and places where documentation consisted of the generational, word of mouth variety? Coincidence....?
&gt; I think a lot of people want to imagine that the Arabs want peace, because they want to imagine that Arabs are somehow "good" people (where "good" implies "peaceful like the Danes")

I don't imagine one way or the other, in all fairness your making the assumptions not me. I know the Muslim faith at this moment has been hijacked by extremists, but what I don't know is how many normal every day Muslims actually support them. This atleast in my case is impossible to find out.

&gt; I think that's incorrect; if the Arabs wanted peace, they'd use Gahndi's strategy to win.

I don't know where to start refuting that statement. How about Gandhi united one country, the Muslim world has so many different leaders with different agendas it would be next to impossible for one person to unite them. Also (in Palestine's case ), many countries and peoples looking for peace go about it the wrong way. Gandhi was an exceptional guy, practically unique in his success, trying to tell people that are being killed and persecuted that peaceful protest will work, is a very hard sell.

Happy with Internet.
That's the best thing I've seen here in a while.

I don't need a fancy algorithm/community system to point me to articles saying that George Bush is a nitwit or that religious nuts of all stripes cause problems.  

On the other hand, I would have never found that article on my own.
"if the Arabs wanted peace, they'd use Gahndi's strategy to win."

The Palestinians don't want 'peace', they want their country back - and that doesn't mean an archipelago of bantustans surrounded by tanks. I like the fact that you feel qualified to prescribe someone's philosophy without checking how to spell his name. Deep.

Is qujibo a Muslim that believes that or is he just trying to state the Muslim position? When I read his comment, my first reaction was that he was doing the latter.
There is a fundamental difference between the Koran and the Bible. Where as the Bible speaks of the life of Jesus in the new testament and mostly about how you as an *individual* should behave, the Koran (and the additional books on the ways of Muhammed) go beyond that and set rules for not only the individual, but also law &amp; punishment and government &amp; state (and even economy).

By Islamic faith, the words in the Koran are 'set in stone', because they are *the* words of God him/herself. There is no changing the words of God. And herein lies the problem: as the world changes, Islam as a religion can't change. Muhammed and his followers where more or less nomads living in the arabian peninsula a thousand years ago. Maybe the laws for the individual and society worked back then, but not in the 21st century...

I know this might sound provocative to some of you, but I think for the sake of Muslims and fellow human beeings, Islam as a religion must learn to change, and to let go of many of the old traditions.
You're still a consumer. Why not try using your time to produce something?
One little thing I wish to point out here. It's quite telling that this publication is using the poisoned term "pirate" in reference to what these litigious companies are doing. They are casting an aspersion on a legal activity. Frankly, I expected a bit more objectivity coming from an entity associating itself with MIT...

I think these patent "pirates" are a fabulous conclusion to a completely broken patent system. By hitting large companies right in their pocketbooks, we will finally see some needed changes in the patent system. Our well-lobbied representatives in Congress will make sure of that.
&gt; The bible as we know it went through many changes before the first protestant religion even popped up. Councils of old Catholics, fat off the selling of indulgences, voted on what books should be in and what shouldn't. Hell, some of what became obscure apocrypha is probably there because certain contingents of Bishops had food poisoning that day, though I'm sure God guided it all with an unseen hand.....

Umm...the Bible was canonized in 325 at Nicea...well before the whole indulgence problem popped up in the Catholic church.

It also wasn't just a matter of voting in what you liked and what you didn't. They had a very strict set of criteria for what would be accepted and what wouldn't.

* Apostolic Origin — attributed to and based on the preaching/teaching of the first-generation apostles (or their close companions). 
* Universal Acceptance — acknowledged by all major Christian communities in the ancient world (by the end of the fourth century). 
* Liturgical Use — read publicly when early Christian communities gathered for the Lord's Supper (their weekly worship services). 
* Consistent Message — containing a theological outlook similar or complementary to other accepted Christian writings. 

There was also the problem of several apocrphyal books being blatantly wrong in their account of history. I believe it is Judith which lists Nebudchadnezzar is king of the Assyrians, which obviously is not true historically.

&gt; Oh, and one quick question. How come God doesn't send colorful miracle-working prophets anymore?

You must not look very far, because there are MANY people who claim to be prophets, though for many of them, their claims are questionable. They certainly are colorful, though.

Also in third-world countries, "miracles" are much more of a common thing. Maybe we have become so inundated with the material that we cannot see the spiritual any longer.

&gt; And why did they have a penchant for showing up in times and places where documentation consisted of the generational, word of mouth variety? Coincidence....?

Say again?

Very important attention
I have not read all the comments about HTDWYL yet, but I will soon.  Here's my two cents:

HTDWYL was, IMHO, written by an individual who possesses extraordinary insight into the process of living.  I compare his insight to that of Maxwell Maltz who developed Psycho- Cybernetics.  If you've read P-C, that is saying a LOT.

HTDWYL could, maybe, be further developed into a practical approach about HOW goalless people (like me) could discover worthwhile goals.  

In P-C Maltz never talked about HOW to engage in goal-setting, per se.....  He just assumed that you HAD a goal or goals, and he more or less proved that they're necessary for fulfillment.  Its impossible to deny his logic and wisdom.  But many people simply DON'T have them, for whatever reason.

Lack of goals doesn't mean you're lazy, incompetent, or anything like that.  It just means that you have interests that are sufficiently varied to preclude intense focus on any particular one.  And maybe "focused" people are just autistic in a different way.

Do we HAVE to have goals?  No.  We exist without them, obviously, but having one or two important goals must be a very good feeling.  I wish I had that feeling most of the time.

Guess I should get back to painting my kitchen (its 4:45 PM as I type this).  Paul Graham DID mention discipline as I recall.

A dilemma. A decent article but I must vote it down on principle. Title in all caps, you know.
What's interesting is that in other statistics of this nature that I've seen, the ease of starting a business corresponds strongly to the strength of the economy.

Note also that this means how easy it is to do business, rather than how 'social' (taking care of the less fortunate, broadly) a country is.  Both anglo-saxon model countries as well as the nordic countries score well.

Here in Italy, instead, it's very difficult to start a business, as you can see from the stats.  You have to have a significant amount of money already to do it, so it is beyond the reach of many people.

The social model here is also (IMO) suboptimal in that there aren't many benefits for the unemployed or poor, but instead, it's hard to fire people, so that the burden is shifted to corporations, who are forced to pay for people they don't need, rather than, say, being taxed as in the nordic countries, so that the government fills that role.  Or, as the society sees fit, simply let people take care of themselves as in the US.  Of course that's a gross oversimplification, but I think it's interesting to look at each one and see what works and what doesn't.
&gt; Both the Bible and the Koran have passages that can be used to justify violence. "I come not to bring Peace but a sword."

You might want to go back and read that in context. Christ was not condoning violence nor telling anyone to use it. He was simply saying that what he taught would be extremely provocative and would turn others (for example communities and families) against each other. And he was correct.

&gt; In the epistles in the N.T., they describe killing an early Christian for charging interest on a loan.

You took this out of context, too.

You are speaking of the classic example of Ananias and Sapphira.

*1Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. 2With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet.*
 
*3Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? 4Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God."* 

*5When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. 6Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.*

It has absolutely nothing to do with "charging interest on a loan" as you claim, and nothing to do with any human killing someone else. You *really* twisted the story there.

&gt; The Old Testament contains many bloodbaths perpetrated by the protagonists, with Yaweh egging on the slaughter, and rebuking those who show mercy or compassion, since his described goal is for the Israelites to conquer various lands he decreed to them and slaughter any who stand in the way.

You'll find those bloodbaths never occured to an innocent nation that did nothing. They occured when other nations attacked Israel first, particularly when they (the Israelites) were in a state of vulnerability.

&gt; Both books are awash with contradictions and inconsistencies, which is a real problem.

I've still yet to find someone who can find honest contradictions. Most of the time it has to do with the person taking the passages out of context (like you did in your above statements).

&gt; Fundamentalists despite claiming that their book is dictated by God, and is absolute truth, never read their religious books seriously or critically. They always pick and choose passages that justify their views. Whatever their religion, fundamentalists foment in their followers fear, alienation, and anger, and in their more extreme forms teach that extremism and violence in the name of religion are right.

That was quite the generalization.

Listen, I have no problem with you being critical of any religion, just be honest when doing so. Blatantly twisting stories to make your point is not being honest.
j.p.,

The Inc. article below describes how he tested it on his own finger in 2000.
Overall his reasons are crappy and not really relevent to designers.

&gt; I don't imagine one way or the other, in all fairness your making the assumptions not me. I know the Muslim faith at this moment has been hijacked by extremists, but what I don't know is how many normal every day Muslims actually support them. This atleast in my case is impossible to find out.

Why do you say its been hijacked? Their violence is no different than that of Muhammad and the immediate Muslim leaders that followed him over the next 300 years.
What do you propose they do? They are a tiny nation that is surrounded by a bunch of nations that hate them and regularly kill their people through suicide bombings and other assorted actions. Need I remind you that Israel didn't even start doing this stuff until the entire Arab world tried to wipe them out in 1967? That's the kind of stuff they have to put up with on a day to day basis.

Your "ethnic cleansing" statement is way off, and though the Israeli government does take harsh actions, it has to. It can't just stand by and be run over.
The argument is pointless, "though shall not kill" is the 6th commandment. We can't accuse the USA or Israel of following this rule when it comes to there treatment of Muslims.

&gt; A president who lies under oath threatens our entire government, as he gnaws at the roots of our democracy.

That's just meaningless rhetoric.  Democracy isn't founded on the absolute integrity of one man.  People are imperfect.  A president can make mistakes, and still do his duty to uphold the principles of democracy.
Best video I have ever seen.
When I clicked on the "comments" link for this article, I braced myself for the worst slashdot-style flameage.  Instead I find thoughtful and (mostly) polite conversation.  I don't know how much longer reddit will stay like this.  It would be marvellous if it were reddit's design that's making this happen: if the flamers hold back because they know they'll get modded down into the sub-basement.  

That's probably too much to hope for, but this page, at least at this instant, shows how great it would be if that happened.
I'm not saying peaceful protest would not work, I think it would. But you have this idea that west (Christian?) countries would act differently under the same circumstances. Which in my opinion is wishful thinking, and not reflected in history.

Also if talking about Palestinians don't say Arab, say Palestinian. 

&gt; That's why they don't just exterminate the Arabs.

I'd be hoping they don't do that, because it would be inhuman and go against the teaching's of their faith.
Given that modern-day Israel was once the home to several million palestinians - none of whom are there any more - it is the most thoroughly ethnically cleansed piece of land on the planet. Ever wonder why the 1967 war happened? a quick peek at the realm of historical fact reveals that close to two million palestinians were dispossessed and removed from the lands/homes they owned (i.e. they held deeds) during the creation of the israeli state.  no-one felt bad about this at the time because europe had just finished attempting to wipe jews off the face of the earth - so merely cleansing two million people from mandate palestine was ok if it helped recompensing for 6 million who had been killed.
In what way is his "ethnic cleansing" statement way off?  From what I've heard, the Palestinians literally have deeds to large amounts of land in what is now "Israel," and the current government won't let them back in because the government could then no longer be both democratic and have a state religion.  Isn't this so?
To say that Christians are less violent is certainly a matter of perspective.  Let's not forget that the Christian nations of the world also possess the biggest, most lethal, and well organized militaries -- this has been true since the days of the Emperor Constantine.

By immeasurable orders of magnitude war is far more violent and destructive than any other act of human violence. All of the deaths and property damage caused by terrorism in the last 100 years combined cannot come close to the violence of even one war.

While (some) Christian individuals may turn the other cheek, they also fund and condone extreme violoence through their war machines.  Muslims do not have this avenue for "flexing muscle" and their dismay carries little weight in the world.  Perhaps, it is their position of relative weakness combined with the lack of any effective means for expressing dissatisfaction that is the catalyst for "violent" reactions (or rhetoric).

Pretty funny. I just don't get the whole mouse head joke, or why they call southeast Asia Microsoft factory. Microsoft is software (obviously) besides the Xbox. I think they should rename it Wal-Mart Factory.
I think the reason the Israelis don't mistreat the Palestinians more is not just that they're afraid of losing support in the rest of the world, but that the country itself is divided.  In addition to the extreme zionists, there is a "silent majority" who see all too clearly the parallels between how Israel treats the Palestinians, and how jews have been treated by oppressive governments in the past.  A couple years ago, when the Israelis were killing large numbers of Palestinians, a cabinet member even spoke out against it, saying that the things he was seeing reminded him of the Warsaw ghetto.
Silly me, I'd started to think I wouldn't upgrade for a couple of years.
The author fails to consider that people are thinking individuals. If when the seat is left down is dependant upon the time, then surely the people involved will try to alter their behaviour so that it benefits them. I'm not sure whether this would help or hinder J or M tho. But in a race condition, it makes sense for M to go first in the morning. However would M try to change her daily patterns so she tended to use it more in the afternoon? If this occured the the distribution is not random anymore and perhaps the time of swapping should then be increased to 1-2pm (also considering that J should have some benefit for giving way in race conditions)?
The Bible doesn't condone what they did. Its very obvious by the Danites own theivery and use of idols that what they did was wrong via the OT laws of the time.

*There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, [d] and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land. 31 They continued to use the idols Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.*

That's the thing about the Bible...it records the good and bad portions of Israelite history, and thus some people take the bad parts and assume the Bible is glorifying those acts, when it isn't doing that as much as being an accurate depiction of history.
&gt; ...and the current government won't let them back in because the government could then no longer be both democratic and have a state religion.

Israel does not have a state religion. Infact, much of the government is composed of secular Jews.
I apologize...in my mind I associated "ethnic cleansing" with genocide, though the two are not synonymous.

But really when you at it, Isreal's policies aren't that different from those of many other modern nations. Ever since the US really got into the idea of nation-states, stuff like this has been going on, in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and several other nations where entire people groups were relocated in order to establish a nation for a particular people group.

Again, I understand what the Israeli government does is harsh, but its not as if they haven't tried to make due with what more or less the UN created. After totally routing the Arab attacks in 1967, they could've kept those territories for a long time. But they haven't, and what do they get for trying to stand a middle position and giving back the Palestinians the West Bank and Gaza? More violence.

So more or less Israel is between a rock and a hard place. Israel realistically needed to be created due to the rampant anti-Semitism that exists throughout the world, but now that they have a created state, they have to waver between keeping that state independent, and being accomadting to their neighbors - who more or less hate them. Its a hard place to be.
There are very many Christians who believe that the Bible is the literal, unquestionable word of God. That doesn't stop them from reading only the parts they want to see.
It's in all caps in the page &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; too, so in this case I think it was just a matter of negligence on the submitter's part rather than an overt attempt at attention-grabbing.
&gt; Man you have got to find out a little bit more about the social and political history of that region. Everything to you is about my Religion is better than yours.

I know quite a bit about the social and political history of Islam, and there is no one who will deny that Muhammad spread Islam by the sword and that Islam reached its peak through warfare.

I'm not trying to say anything about "my religion is better than yours", I'm just observing what happened in history.
Neither Judaism nor Islam has a commandment to "love thy neighbor" in their holy texts. There is a hadith that reads,  "None of you believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself," but hadiths come from Muhammad rather than God (not to say that Muhammad is fallible or anything).

There is also Sufism, which is an esoteric sect of Islam with interesting and remarkable parallels to Buddhism, but some Islamic scholars have a dim view of Sufism.
Mouse -&gt; Moose?
Probably because lots of people that aren't active in communities like slashdot (which don't get mod points there but have mod powers here) are more thoughtful and polite than the active ones? Which is why modding seems a lot better here.

But then I hope the system here isn't open to abuse at the same time..

&gt; Umm...the Bible was canonized in 325 at Nicea...well before the whole indulgence problem popped up in the Catholic church.

No it wasn't. It went through many changes. Here's a link to a [university site timeline](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/a/canon.html). The 325  C.E. Council of Nicea was more about Constantine having the new Bishops solidify something for him to work with as he established the empire under a new religion (at mom's urging if I remember correctly.) I believe the historical importance of it with regard to orthodoxy was that it spelled out the Man/God combo of Jesus in the **Nicean Creed.** They still recite that badboy at Catholic services (among others), as it is permanently ingrained in my head after 20 years of indoctrination.

That timeline, and the texts I was checking out only include what we know about. The theological councils of *The One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church* were likely more secretive then than they are now. It looks like the big codification took place in response to that rebel, Martin Luther, who, I will admit, had balls the size of coconuts.

With regard to the "colorful miracle working-prophets", colorful was an adjective to modify *miracle-working*. I'm curious why religions tend to have a consistent theme of miracle working prophets that existed hundreds or thousands of years ago, and had their stories passed on by word of mouth for generations before the first written accounts started popping up. 

Have you ever played 'Telephone', that game where little kids whisper in each others ear, and the final kid compares his translation with the original? Take the innocent, harmless aspect of the game away, and then throw in the historical power politics that used religion to their advantage (How about Constantine and Nicea for example?). **Then** throw in the inherent human desire for a higher power.

I'd like to believe in Christianity, or even another loving religion, but, you see, if God was gonna throw in Free Will as a crucial tenant, and then play the game of historical telephone, then I'll take agnosticism, thanks.
I think you'll find that the anti-semitic position was made very eloquently by the cartoons themselves. Anti-semitism and disagreement with Israeli foreign/domestic policy are two entirely different things but some dissemblers try to muddle them up.
Eh, it's quite a mix. They have fresh fruit daily, things like yogurt and juice, and some reasonably healthy snack items in addition to the junk food. It's up to the individual employee how they treat themselves.

Why stop at Fundamentalists? Secular Humanists committed mass murder (Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Castro). Basically violence is a terrible part of human nature.
might be because the Reddit community is still small ...
Which wars in particular are you talking about which the Christian's "War Machines" caused violent destruction?

First World War? Europeans invade each other's countries. Not in the name of Christianity

Second World War? Fascists try to take over the world. Fascists rejected Christianity wholesale. Rest of the world beats them.

Cold War? Communists start taking over Europe. West gets concerned and arms. No particular Christian perspective to the war, except the Communists banned all religions.

Vietnam War? North Vietnam funded by China attempts to annex South Vietnam. After a few years everyone in America gets tired of it and goes home. Can't see the Christian context there?

The 2 Gulf Wars? Over Iraq Invading Kuwait and the search for WMDs. Again no particular Christian endorsement. In fact most Church leaders where quite anti-war.

Methinks you've mixed up Christianity with the West. They are different you know. Not every decision made in the West is automatically Christian.

The N.T. and O.T. do have passages that can be used to justify violence, but as I said most of those that use them to justify violence are not reading the passages critically or seriously - they are finding what they are looking for.  I agree that in general Jesus' message was one of peace.  But the various writers of the books of the N.T. slipped in a few passages that are pro-violence, and the Bible itself is both contradictory and gives plenty of material for those who want to use it to justify violence:

Luke 22:35-38: 'And He said to them, "When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?" They said, "No, nothing." And He said to them, "But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one. For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, 'And he was numbered with transgressors'; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment." They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough."' - If Jesus is telling his followers to buy weapons, I expect Jesus means for them to use them.

John 2:13-16 'When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the Temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the Temple, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves he said: "Get out of here."'  Jesus was hitting people with a whip.

Luke 19:26-27 'I say to you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.  As for my enemies who do not want me to reign over them, bring them here and kill them in my presence'

Matthew 10:34-35 "Do not think that I have come to send peace on Earth.  I did not come to send peace, but a sword.  I am sent to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law" - Your previous interpretation is extra-textual.

Gen 4:15 (et al) God is a vengeful God.
Exodus 15:3 (et al) God is a fierce warrior.
Leviticus 26:7-8 (et al) The spirit of God kills people.
Ezra 6:12 God is jealous and furious.
Gal 5:22-23 The fruit of the Spirit of God is peace , love, joy, patience, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  

Gen 11:7-9 God himself sows discord.
Proverbs 6:16-19 God hates those who sows discord.

Exodus 20:5 - Children should and do suffer for their parent's sins
Deuternonmy 24:16 - Children are not to suffer for their parent's sins.

Gen 1:3-5 On the first day, God created light, then separated light and darkness.
Gen 1:14-19 The sun (which separates night and day) wasn't created until the fourth day.
Gen 1:11-12, 26-27 Trees were created before man was created.
Gen 2:4-9 Man was created before trees were created.

Gen 1:20-21, 26-27 Birds were created before man was created.
Gen 2:7, 19 Man was created before birds were created.

Gen 1:24-27 Animals were created before man was created.
Gen 2:7, 19 Man was created before animals were created.

Gen 1:26-27 Man and woman were created at the same time.
Gen 2:7, 21-22 Man was created first, woman sometime later.

Gen 10:5 There were many languages before the Tower of Babel
Gen 11:1 There was one language before the Tower of Babel

2 Kings 8:26 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign.
2 Chronicles 22:2 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign.

2 Samuel 6:23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death 
2 Samuel 21:8 But the king took...the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul.

In the N.T. there are two accounts of Jesus' genealogy which are contradictory.:
Matthew 1:1-17 
Luke 3:23-38

There are two inconsistent accounts of his death:

Luke23:46: And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost." 
John 19:30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

I could go on for many pages with more examples of contradictions and justifications for violence in the Bible.  The book is  a serious mess, and really could have used a few talented editors to clean it up. 

We also have many outright errors in the bible: 
I Kings 7:23-26 -  Pi is equal to three.
Lev 11:20-21 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you. -Except that birds don't crawl on all fours.
Lev 11:6 "And the hare, because he cheweth the cud..."
more hare chewing cud:
Deut 14:7 "...as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof."
Matt 13:31-32: "the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which…is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree." - there are plenty of seeds smaller than a mustard seed.  Also mustard plants don't grow into trees.

You are correct that I misrecalled the details of the Ananias and Sapphira as I was rushing through, and while I have read the N.T. (and have read Mark and John in Greek), it was a while back, so I conflated keeping a few buck for themselves with usury.  I really am afraid that I am not really interested in the Bible these days, so my memory of details is fading.

As for generalizing about fundamentalists, would you say that the Christian fundamentalists *are* really understanding the true nature of their religion when they murder doctors, police, bomb buildings?  When you read their writings, and see their hate crimes, do you not find fear, alienation, and anger?  If not, what would you say drives people to murder their fellow men in the name of religion?

Your notion that all the tribes that were slaughtered in the O.T. were somehow asking for it, and that the slaughter even their children and animals is utterly abhorrent.  Saying that the murder of children is acceptable due to their parent's transgressions is beyond the pale.

I propose a test. Bloody up the Reddit alien a bit and see if there is a sudden surge of visitors. Heck, you could even lend him to the SawStop people so they could demonstate.

If Reddit alien gets chopped in half, SawStop is a failure, but if he survives, Reddit gets free publicity (albeit Reddit alien may have a few scratches).

Sorry about the misunderstanding, but it seemed to me that you where coming to your conclusion about Arabs agreeing with this stuff because the Palestinians voted for Hamas. Anyway my mistake.
gerrymandering can be a good: allowing two representatives to represent two different homogenous groups of people with similar political interest is more efficient than having each of those representatives representing more heterogynous groups. however, perhaps if the representatives had to deal with the heterogynous population they could find common solutions more easily.
The Talmud, and Jewish thought, strictly require the saving of life on the Sabbath. (Talmud Shabbos 30A) Your book by Israel Shahak is used as antisemitic propaganda, despite having been written by an embittered Jewish holocaust survivor who blames the holocaust and Israeli politics on the Jewish religion. Of course, you probably have no such excuse for your antisemitism.
I suspect that would be a violation of the terms of the labor agreement after last month's strike.
To those pointers, I would have to add today: Don't just use the default name that Windows gives your computer (L9RDK5000 or somesuch). That is a hideous thing to encounter on a LAN.

According to you: "Neither Judaism nor Islam has a commandment to "love thy neighbor in their holy texts"

I can't speak for Islam, but in Judaism here are two of several.

"Love thy neighbor as thyself." - Leviticus 19:18

And as Rabbi Hillel said:
"What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: This is the entire Torah, the rest is but an elaboration. Now go and learn it!" (Babelonian Talmud, Shabbos 31A)
Yup, that's what it is - see the website of the Royal Hospital Chelsea: http://www.chelsea-pensioners.co.uk/admissions.asp

No joke. I used to work at a lumberyard and was nearly run through with a flying piece of wood caught between the fence and the blade. It was a piece of cedar I was ripping. The blade got quite hot, bound just a bit and the 2" wide and 8 foot long strip expelled from the saw with such a speed that I had no clue what happened. I was even looking right at it, but the thing moved so fast I couldn't tell what happened. I found it lying 50' away. It flew nearly perfectly flat for 50', dropping not more than 1" over that distance. 

Since objects moving horizontally fall towards the ground at the same speed as objects falling straight down, I'm guessing that for a board to cross 50' and drop 1" it needs to be moving like a motherfuckering tornado shank. My face was but 2' from the board, my hands about 4" from it, when the thing went wooosh.

Or they don't want to answer your question. I do this all the time.
I disagree, in that Islamic countries have *already* had an Enlightenment.  When Europe was going through its Dark Ages, Islam was flourishing and producing great things such as algebra.  The concept of "progress" is not a certainty, it is not inevitable, and we must be careful not to let our own culture slide backwards.

You are especially right in that we must introspect on our own society.  The specter of fundamentalism is rising, it's [running our government](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/poor_superman.php), and if we're not careful in the future we'll end up poor, angry, violent, and at the whim of more powerful countries (such as China, from whom we borrow  to cover our massive deficit).
Who cares how fast he/she can read?  Reading (esp. a good book like the one I'm enjoying now: http://store.yahoo.com/doverpublications/0486270777.html).  Screw speed reading!  It is just another example of how the modern world wants us to cram more, more, more into less, less, less time and taking no pleasure in what we do .. just a constant rush to the next thing while the last thing is quickly forgotten.
And how can we forget the greatest arab contribution: fermented beverages. A people that invented algebra surely needed some balance in life.

If you’re made of money, you might want to buy more robust hardware than Microtel sells. But the computer does seem to be reasonably sound (I just wouldn’t go dropping it on the floor, banging it with a spatula, or anything like that). If you’re looking for a good entry-level Linux OS and are willing to pay for it ($69.99 — less than Windows, at any rate), Xandros has significant advantages. If you want free, there’s other stuff out there that works fine.

Actually the Sumerians were the first culture we know of making beer.  They were not ethnic Arabs, though they were in the ancient near east.

I tried to use this as an argument to keep the names of my servers across Australia back in the '90s.  I had French, Saunders, Abbott &amp; Costello (both politicians in the ruling federal party at the time!  Disappointingly, I think they still are, although I have since departed Oz to escape them) and a bunch of others, all named after comedians (and with the same first letter as the city in which they were based).  I thought it was kinda cool; but it wasn't able to stand up to the Ops manager's desire for convention across all servers in the place.

This article has reduced something to a singularity -- it's not so much about asking questions, but instead being engaged in learning. That's what you're suggesting. People who are engaged in learning take ownership in the experience. Ensuring they have asked questions to fill in the gaps in their mind is part. That isn't something unique to smart people, but involved learners.
I remember hearing this guy, Carl Zimmer, on This American Life. He discusses some other behavior of parasites during a piece on [the show.](http://www.thislife.org/pages/archives/archive04.html)

Look for episode 274. 

&gt;Carl Zimmer, author of the book Parasite Rex, talks with Ira about how parasites manage the trick of living inside of us, behind enemy lines, without us finding out. (11 minutes).
I think your claim is *more* difficult to take seriously.  He didn't lie about sexually molesting a woman, he lied about receiving plo chops.  Exactly what you cited.  And then you say that "gnaws at the roots of our democracy," when in fact its at the very most a nibble.  The sexual affairs of our presidents, and the lies they tell about such, has remarkably little impact on the functioning of our government.

That is, they have little impact, unless a sex-crazed media and congress spend millions investigating it, for no discernible reason other than as a hatchet job.  Clinton had many faults, Monica was one of the least; his inconsistency regarding Bosnia and Rwanda, and even trifles such as Travel Gate were more important.
Castro has locked away whole populations of people for various reasons.  In the case I'm most familiar with from university, he marched thousands of male and female prostitutes into camps to be "reeducated" after he took power.  

Apparently the revolutionaries felt that spending most of your life (many Cuban prostitutes were very young) fellating rich foreigners during the Batista regime caused one to be *unseemly* or *undignified* -- a condition that only years  of forced agricultural labor could cure.

Interestingly, "undignified" men were treated much more harshly than "undignified" women.  You'd almost think that all those Good Cuban Marxists thought the men had committed some special *sin* or something.

You can draw your own conclusions about whether secular Marxist humanism, or the humanist Catholicism it supplanted (yes, Catholicism is indeed a humanist tradition -- look it up) are workable apologist ideologies for crimes against humanity.

Oh, yeah, and if for some reason you think that Castro doesn't deserve to be on the list with Mao (79 million citizens killed) and Stalin (40 million) for killing "only" a few thousand hookers, he's still got a long history of imprisoning journalists, suppressing political dissent (you think anyone disses the state in Cuba?), and confiscating his people's property through engineered currency revaluations.
I can't believe nobody's questioned the premise of this headline yet.  I don't know very many Muslims and none well, but none of the ones I knew were violent.  Taken literally, it's absurd to say that Muslims always, or even usually, resort to violence.

Maybe the person who wrote that letter to the editor meant to say something else about the violence that we hear about in the news, but it's unclear to me what they were trying to say or why it's interesting enough to show up on reddit.

Methinks these gentlemen have a very, to put it simply, odd definition of humanism.

These men you speak of - secularists, yes. Humanists? Heck no.
Karma doesn't mean anything.

You can submit a thousand stories and still have 1-2 karma. You get like 100+ when your story makes the "hot" page. It's just a pat-me-on-the-back like Digg's front page count.

hmm, reality is stranger than fiction. i remember a website that had scanned drawings from american adults who had been asked to draw australia. some were pretty close, most were blobs, a couple looked like the united states, one or two people did an oval with a question mark next to it - no idea. 

my friend was in new york, and was chatting to a lady on the street. he mentioned he was from new zealand and asked the lady if she knew where that was. she said 'yeah .. europe somewhere'. 

'close, you're close', he replied.
I think she distrusted it despite believing this -- she certainly thought that there were better ways to ensure a positive outcome than through government intervention.
It is irresponsible to post a headline touting, "GOP candidate attacks opponent..." when the story it links to has NO proof that the assertion is true. I'm not saying that I think the GOP candidate didn't do it, only that insinuations are far from definitive. 

It is not at all unreasonable to imagine a scenario where a blogger with ties to a candidate becomes over zealous and takes things too far. If one were to do a google search on "guilt by association" and fallacy, one would get many hits.
Actually, the vast majority of the much-lamented bloodshed in the 20th Century was perpetrated by atheists,  nationalists, and racists.  Honestly, have religious fundamentalists come even close to these numbers?

* Military Casualties WWI ~8 Million (more than all previous  European wars?)
* Military Casualties in WWII: 25 million

* Deaths due to Mao' Great Leap Forward: ~35 million
* Deaths due to Mao's Cultural Revolution/State Terror: ~30 million
* Deaths under Stalin: engineered famine/state terror: 20-40 million
* Polish non-Jews killed by Germans during WWII: ~1.8 million
* Jewish Holocaust Victims: ~6 million
* non-Jewish Holocaust Victims (disabled, homosexual, Jehovah's Witnesses, communists, Slavs, Russian POWs, Roma): ~ 2-6 million
* Civillian deaths in Russia, WWII:  11 million
* Russian Military Casualties, WWII: 10 million
* Civillian deaths in China, WWII: 6 million
* Military deaths in China, WWII: 4 million
* Deaths under Cambodian Communist regime(s): 2 million (extermination of urban population)
* Deaths under Vietnamese Communist regime: 1 million
* Deaths under various Eastern European communist governments: 1 million
* Deaths due to Soviet Aggression in Afghanistan: 1.6 million
* Deaths under North Korean Communist regime: 2 million
* Deaths under Iraqi Baathist regime: 290-500 thousand

None of the victims are of any particular religion, unless you count the extermination of Eastern European Jews by Nazis.  But then, I would think that the Nazi campaigns against gypsies, homosexuals, communists, Jehovah's witnesses, Russians, Ukranians, Poles, Slavs, etc. show that the animus against Jews was at least partly racial as opposed to theological.

None of the perpetrators of these crimes were of any particular religion, unless you argue that Marxism, Marxism-Leninism, or "Communism" are religions.  Hence, none of these crimes have really been perpetrated by "fundamentalists" -- although they were definitely carried out by fanatics.

All of this is a rather roundabout way of saying, when you talk about the United States "using fundamentalism as an ideological tool against ... progressive nationalism and communism", or wax regretful over the many crimes of Christian fundamentalists in the US, or talk up the import of protecting "The West" from Muslim fundamentalists in the Persian Gulf, that we all have to keep these things in the proper perspective.

Of course, if you note the relatively small numbers associated with the first two items on the list, you begin to wonder whether all the pap and sentiment we get on TV about "man's inhumanity to man" shouldn't really be phrased "The State's inhumanity to man".  Really -- why not?

I live in Japan, so for me watching TV is what I do when I'm trying to force myself to "work" at learning the language. So, I only watch about 3 hours a week now. Also I basically stopped watching TV for parts of  college and high school as well, since I had other things to do. 

Nevertheless, I am still strongly of the opinion that people who think that not watching TV makes you a better person are, for the most part, pretentious asshats. I mean, seriously, if we give you a halo to put on your head, will you shut up and stop bragging to us already? Ugh.

You're certainly right that people who are sufficiently, er, motivated to think about killing people will also be motivated enough to look for a justification until they find one or, failing that, make one up from whole cloth.

And I don't know a lot about the bible, but I do think you're reading a few of the passages above in the wrong light.

Michel Foucault, the French 'historian' and general po-mo guy, drew an interesting distinction in history between societies that were 'repressive' and societies that were 'ideological.'  The idea is that, once upon a time, the easiest way to make everyone in a given society behave themselves was to make all social decisions economic -- bad behavior was punished gruesome public torture, i.e. the negative utility for breaking the rules was astronomically high even if it wasn't likely you'd get caught.  The key point for this discussion is that the punishments were more intended for deterrent effect than they were to exact retribution.

Eventually, societies became too disparate and too specialized for repressive social structures to work any more so the ideological society evolved, wherein we internalize a society's values and feel *guilt*.  We punish ourselves for thinking about crime, and so only rarely manage to actually commit any.

Ideological societies are a recent development -- say maybe starting in Britain in the mid 1800s.  The Israelites and early Christians were both definitely repressive, which means that they *viewed violence in a fundamentally different way than we do*.  That is, setting unbelievers on fire or cutting off people's hands for stealing were just the way an effective society was administered.

On the other hand, a political scientist would note that even in these enlightened times, every traffic ticket and IRS reporting regulation is ultimately collected or enforced by the threat of violence.  In fact, we can even define "The State" as "holder of the monopoly on the legitimate first use of force in a given geographic area."  But we don't really consider parking citations violent -- they're just something we have to keep our society in working order.
You're kidding too, right?
For the sake of those who really don't know, 'Radioactive Area', is a reference to the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan 60 years ago to end WWII.

Yes, the Islamic culture was lightyears ahead of Europe during the Dark ages. But that enlightenment happened mostly in the area of science and technology like mathematics, the alphabet, astronomy etc. Europe had its great thinkers like Diderot and Voltaire who started questioning God, meaning of life and the individuals right of expressing themselves freely. There was a slow shift away from the mysticism of the dark ages that crippled thought.

The Islamic culture started out great, but has been at a standstill or even moved backwards in the last centuries - largely due to its intrinsic nature that the words in the Koran can never be changed or questioned, the laws affecting *every* aspect of society (from politics to economy to individual rights), mysticism, strong traditions etc etc.

The world changes, but Islam has great difficulty changing *with* it.

However, seeing what has happened in the US and Europe the last few years - the rise of christian fundamentalism - makes you wonder if the western societies are moving towards another period of Dark ages?

I teach algebra at an inner-city school. Sure, the kids don't all know the multiplication tables. But with calculators, most of them can learn algebra more easily than they can the times table. The hurdle is getting them to acccept that we can talk and reason about a number, when we don't even know what then number is, yet. And that we can use letters as place-holders for those numbers.

That's not to say I ignore remedial work on arithmetic, but kids who've had bad experiecnces for years at learning one thing often find it harder to overcome their resistance to what they 'know' they can't do than to learn something new. And there's no reason in the age of calculators built into cell-phones that algebra absolutely has to wait for proficiency in the mecahnics of multiplication.

[deleted]
With you there. The president can absolutely be removed from office for commission of a felony. Whether or not he *should* be removed from office is debatable.

If you think that commission of a felony, any felony, including perjuring about adultery, means that the country must absolutely have a different president, then that makes it sound like legality entails morality. And I'm sure you don't agree with that.

Can you break it down another way?

&gt; “Gebrauchtwagen” means “used car” in German. How often does this word appear in the doorway page? 42 times... ...entering “gebrauchtwagen bmw” into Google yields it as top result.
The modern WWW standards are quite clear on how to make pages that are accessible to people with disabilities and to search engines.  You can't justify poor design by calling it progressive.

Where's the antisemetism? Please say what s/he said that is untrue.

We are talking about an actual event that took place in '55-'56, not your dishonest interpretation of the Talmud. 

You give Jews a bad name with your lying.
It doesn't matter if he's a muslim, jew, hindu, satanist or guava worshipper.

Clearly he has a brain and is capable of reasonable discourse. 
And yeah, it just seems like he's stating the Muslim position, which anyone who looks at  the religion/culture would know.
And therein lies the root of his twisted philosophy - give up everything good in life, including life itself, to dedicate your life to forcing others to do the same.  A more purely evil philosophy could not possibly exist.  It is simply self-imposed misery to spread misery, by force, upon others.
I'm all for the West standing up for freedom of expression, loudly and unapologetically. 

However then the author blows his credibility with a justification of colonialism. In one particularly inane passage, he states that British rule in India helped with famine relief. It is generally accepted that it caused at least one [famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1770). 

Whatever the merits of Islam or social democracy, this author is merely looking for a reason to announce that his own culture is superior.
I thought he didn't say it was open to interpretation, just that it described a different reality.

E.g. there is the natural world and the world of the Koran. The Koran, when it doesn't concur with the natural world, doesn't apply.

So the Koran is still not open to interpretation; it just concerns a world that isn't our world. A bit like string theory, or some other seemingly unprovable system.

That's quite Talmudic, no?
Yeah, but that would be better rendered as "love your Jew-neighbor as yourself."

It's slower than direct connections. There is always a price to be paid for anonymous data communication. However routing in the MUTE network is based on a technique called "ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION" (ACO). ACO is extremely good at finding shortest routes in a network, and also at patching broken routes. So if a node on a data transfer route leaves the network, MUTE automatically redirects data to the next shortest route. Also the MUTE network is zero trust. There is no weakness, like you have to trust your neigbour nodes or anything. In my opnion the MUTE network is the most promising anonymous network. It still needs work in some areas, but it's getting there. There are several MUTE clients, and most of them are not up to par yet. I am the author of Kommute (www.kommute.net).

It's a simple issue of proper maintainance. If all articles which lead to decent texts get voted up even if it links through a blog, has a horrible title/descrip, goes with all-caps, or any other pet peeve, the message that is delivered to reddit submitters is simple: Don't waste any time making it easy on the eyes for the reddit readers. No one cares.

Looking at the rapidly deteriorating signal-to-noise ratio of digg, I'm of the opinion that requiring a rather basic redressing of the title is the very /least/ that should be demanded of a submitter.

In other words, it does not matter if it was negligence on the submitters part. Either reason (attention-grabbing or negligence) is enough to vote it down in order to improve the chances that reddit remains readable in the long term.
There's a wrong assumption in there: If John is living alone and puts the toilet seat back up after op#2, the article claims this is inefficient behaviour. It isn't. How often do you perform two op#2s in a row without an op#1 in between?

I'd say that event's chance of occurence is so low it can be ignored out of rote.

Once you get to cohabitation, the article's main gist, this argument loses some steam.

Not true. Ant Colony Optimization is a proven scientific field and well known optimization technique. See http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~mdorigo/ACO/ACO.html for more info.

This reply is just an example of the modern nazis who deny the history has it happend.
No one wiped 2 million palestinians out of israel. This is just a lie. For most, there were not more than several hundred of arabs who lived under the british occupation (the "mandat"). In 48 when the jewish people *returned* into the holy land, there was an offer, accepted by the zionist leadership which said that all the palestinians will stay in their towns and the country will be divided in a much more pro-arab way than anyone can imagine these days.
You should go and search in wikipedia about the 1947 UN Partition Plan, which was rejected by the arabs who preffered to start a war against israel.
To make things short, muslims have much more time to spread lies over the internet, but whoever wants to know a little bit more, just run a quick search in google and find some objective sites with information. You will find that many things that you read in site comments are just plan lies.
In any case, just look how every issue with arabs return to the israeli - palestinian problem like a denish cartoonist is related to israel. What you don't understand is that the arab jihad is coming towards you in really big steps and what seems now to be israel's problem will hurt you in the near future.

I hate articles by programmers who (claim to) have written complex programs in an inordinately short time.  And anyway, there's nothing so special about Guile/Lisp/Scheme in this instance that wouldn't have allowed a similarly compact implementation to have been written in Perl/Python/Ruby.

:) That's a good one.
The 'water' looks odd because of 'the uncanny valley'. Still very impressive though.
Sure, I'm not saying that you can't get certain optimizations over digraphs through random walks, nor am I saying that ant colony optimization doesn't happen. What I'm saying is that ACO has not been proven to map to the domain of message passing over small world networks with attributes of optimality or anonimity. Ants work reasonably well at food gathering, but the problem of food gathering isn't obviously isomorphic to the problem of message passing. From the information you give, there are obvious scalability issues, as well as traffic analysis and potential active attacks (by rogue nodes).

haha, so a simulation of politics of sorts?

* 2006: Device sticks to car.
* 2106: Device sticks to car, bores into cabin, crawls over and sticks to driver.
In anonymous rerouting networks, there are always issues of traffic analysis and active attacks. It all comes down to how powerful the adversary is in terms of network resources, and the compromises made between speed (bandwith usage) and anonymity. No rerouting network will ever be 100% free of attacks. If the adversary owns all other nodes in the network, it is very difficult (impossible) to stay anonymous. But this discussion is to lengthy to continue here.

ACO maps directly to the problem of finding shortest paths in a graph. You are right that ACO is not garanteed to find the shortest path. However that is not important in a p2p network.

The scalability of MUTE is actually surprisingly good, due to the adaptive nature of ACO, where data constantly migrates towards the fastest ( shortest ) routes. This means that if a node that is part of a route, is being swamped with data, other routes might be faster. And MUTE uses a stochaistic model to keep less frequently travelled routes alive. One of these routes may turn out to be faster and will slowly gain more traffic. Thus freeing the swamped node of traffic.
And if it really achieved these speeds I imagine it would be out of sight pretty quickly, so it is even harder to control.

Good article, someone should post it to reddit

&gt; Some 32,000 Americans are rushed to emergency rooms with table-saw-related injuries each year... ...the CPSC estimated the annual economic cost of table-saw injuries to be $2 billion. That's more than 10 times the size of the entire $175 million table-saw market. Clearly, this is an industry that could use a better mousetrap.

"Whatever the merits of Islam or social democracy, this author is merely looking for a reason to announce that his own culture is superior."

If you had noted the author:

"Best-selling author and Muslim dissident Ibn Warraq argues..."

He's not claiming 'his own culture is superior', rather that it(islam)) has some issues, and that we(western democracies) have to be very vigilant if we are not to get those same issues ourselves.
"Atheists, nationalists, and racists": what does atheism have to do with nationalism or racism? I can see how nationalism and racism can feed off each other, but atheism? And how is nationalism and racism distinct from any particular religion?

"Oh, he's not a (Christian|Jew|Muslim), he's a *nationalist*."
"Don't lump her in with my religion, she's a *racist*." Yeah...

This topic is being beaten to death. I think there are a few useful points we can extract from all of the typing going on:

* Religions can be interpreted by people in any number of ways.
* Religion isn't the only thing that motivates people to do things.
* Religions have in many cases books that say things that today we find both uplifting and repugnant.
* Having no religion is no protection against doing stupid/evil things.

If you use Word as a "professional writer" and do the layout yourself (as described at the beginning of this article) you really should consider trying something else, like, say, plain-text files.
This is a beautiful example of the division of labor and using the right tool for the right job.  Scheme is one of the easiest languages to write an evaluator in, but YACC is one of the easiest ways to write a parser.  Plug the two together, and I see how you've got a super-fast-path to an interpreter.  This idea never occured to me before, but I will have to try it.
Interesting, but they could use an editor:

'... a green lazar light ...'

'The officer also will have a remote unit, about the size of a device that unlocks a car, when they're outside the patrol car.'

What device would that be? A newfangled dooflotchy like a key?

no, i noticed that as well. there seemed to be no contrasting argument for what adulthood was supposed to look like. this make his argument seem heavily biased and selective in it's choices of subjects to attack. 

he also ignores the phenomenon of the last 20 or so years of adolescents wanting to be adults before their time. in the 80's and 90's the idea of being a carefree, immature teenager was greatly looked down upon. in the 80's you had to be smoking, drinking and sneaking into 'r' rated movies by the time you were 13 and in the 90's (early 90's at any rate) you had to be a serious, dour political activist who listend to 'serious' alternative music and cried over the erosion of the wetlands by the time you were in middle school. i think some of the phenomenon he is witnessing might be related to this, in that, if people have no real adolescence they might get nostalgic for an idealized version of what they believed their teenage years were or should have been.
LOL burn the American embassy, damn sinners
That's so badly laid out. Haven't they heard of paragraph spacing? No one is going to read that unless they're really desperate.
Very formulaic. This reads like one of those New York Times articles on "How today's women go to college to find a husband," with no supporting statistics and a handful of misrepresented annecdotes.

The author is conflating several phenomena: (a) The rise a geek culture where 20-somethings buy toys (because face it, Legos are cool), (b) the large adult market for video games (odd, but longstanding), (c) the tendency of European 20-somethings to live at home (unsurprising, given high unemployment), and (d) the large number of young Japanese women who live at home and refuse to get married (because doing so would cost them their independence).

It's not clear that all these phenomena are even related.  This sort of article is basically the college-educated version of trashy tabloid news: A bunch of dubious stories strung together and coated with satisfyingly judgmental attitude.

Yow.  Table saws are insanely dangerous--I know people who've been very nearly killed by them, and who spent months in physical theraphy--and this technology fixes one of the two big safety risks.

The other safety risk, of course, is kickback of the wood, which occurs when certain kinds of jams occur, and the wood gets flung backwards off the table saw at high speed.  That's why you always stand to the *side* of the wood.

Yes, several hundred. How silly of me.
It very much does have a state religion. Non-Jews cannot naturalize as Israeli citizens without converting. Many areas of Israeli law are based on halkha and talmudic law. Israel's single greatest problem is it's inability to resolve a secular identity with these and other facts that make non-jews second-class citizens. If Israel were to become properly secular, Jewish Israelis may find themselves outnumbered over time and in the same position they were in Europe early last century - a persecuted minority.

The other caveat is that the drivers will know they're being tracked so they'll be more likely to carjack people every few miles.
This is why there should be no regulations on starting a business.  This guy is actually producing his wonderful technology himself, but who knows how many other people have had good ideas and didn't implement them because starting a business is hard, and all the regulations favor established large companies who have a head start and more resources.  The large companies don't want to relinquish their market share, and the government is just helping them prevent new and better technology from being produced.

"Well, at this stage it is still a theory, isn't it?"

Technically, but the word "theory" has different meanings in and out of scientific discourse.  For the average Joe, "theory" tends to mean "some explanation I dreamed up."  But in science, there are conjectures and hypothesis and theories; referring to something as a theory means that it is pretty damn well supported.  It means there are repeatable experiments for verifying predictions, and at least the possibility of demonstrating that the theory is wrong.  Used in this sense, the Big Bang may be a theory, but ID is at best a conjecture.

BTW, since theories are so easily dismissed, should we now expect Bush to ignore concerns over Iran's nuclear program?  

After all, relativity is just a theory.


It's ingeneusly simple. I love hearing about things like that.
Religion creates teams.  God or no god, there's power in organizing.
I'm beginning to think that the best sign of societal progress is the extent to which people can prolong adolescence.

Seems that in more brutish times, boys became men quite early, required to go hunt, kill, toil, and such at young age.   Hardly anything to aspire to. 

And, to echo some of emk's points, there is a world of difference between being eternally adolescent and simply immature and irresponsible.  

The article isn't all bad; I learned the word 'kidult', a label I proudly bear.

So I suppose Dawkins is now joining the "Hall of Fame" here at Reddit along with Paul Graham and others?

Submit an article by him and see how high it goes!

Anyway, Dawkins is awfully short-minded if even viewing religion through a Darwinistic perspective he cannot see its benefits.

Religion gives people hope and determination. Often that is all that is needed to help those that aren't the strongest physically or emeotionally to continue on.

This of course is viewing it through an entirely atheistic standpoint. I personally see many other benefits to Christianity (ie, talking to God), but not everyone has that viewpoint, and that's okay with me.

The truth is, Dawkins has an extremely biased standpoint, just as I do. Dawkins' set goal is to destroy religion. He's obviously not going to see any benefits of religion because he isn't looking very hard for them anyway. He doesn't want to see them. To him religion is an abhorance and something to completely avoid.

I'm glad people like Martin Luther King didn't completely avoid it.

Religion also creates a society that accepts people that aren't as intelligent as this guy. Do you really think it's a good idea to leave 90% of the world's population out in the cold for the sole benefit of the 10% that can actually understand the humanist and scientific arguments for secularism? Doesn't sound like a very nice thing to do -- or a very safe thing for that matter.

I certainly recognize that organized religion is F.U.B.A.R., but its abolition would be too much for the world to take.
Programs that dont have to be installed just one easy download torrent
Erm, actually, Dawkins presents a hypothesis about what the benefits of religion are in the article. (Or more accurately, the benefits of the psychological tendencies which lead to religious belief).
If you /read the article/, you'd see that's pretty much what Dawkins himself is saying.
The argument for secularism is dead simple: "don't belive in X if there is no good evidence for X". In many countries (for example here in the UK) it's fairly unusual for someone to have strong religious beliefs. Most people (stupid people included) get on just fine without believing in God.
This decision will ultimately hurt Yahoo and AOL, because their users will get angry when they don't get their receipts and other such transactional emails from sites that refuse to pay an AOL tax.
The Israelis claim quite a big part of the Orient, because god gave it to Abraham. There was genocide when Moses and Josua came from Egypt and reclaimed Israel. They were even punished for not killing everyone.

These are the parts i don't understand about god. I nevertheless believe Jesus is my saviour, but i'm getting off topic.

Genocide being a "routine" is too much.
Well, I posted it because it is a good and readable text, not the 100st interview or news story about Dawkins.

Dawkins sees there is religion in the world, and as a scientist, he tries to explain its existence within the framework he normally uses.

And that approach is interesting, whether you agree with him or not.
I agree with you, except that part where you say that someone *MUST* be punished for commission of a crime.

There are many people who have committed felonies for which I do not think they should be punished. Myself, for example. I don't think I should go to jail for giving marijuana to my grandpa or for giving copyrighted music to my friends.

Similarly, I don't think Clinton should have been removed from office for perjury about his adultery. We might make a different value judgment there, and I understand your point of view.

&gt; And, if it is proven that Bush did anything illegal, he too *MUST* be punished. 

He claims that the law does not apply to his actions. So it's impossible for him to do anything illegal. If you do not accept that claim, then he has admitted to doing several illegal things. Your statement is naive.
Well I'm very depressed about the poor response to http://reddit.com/info?id=wv5
Very useful anecdote.  It wraps up in a nicely digestible form a number of underappreciated insights:
1-human time is usually more important that CPU time, even when you are optimizing for CPU time.
2-higher-level languages tend to win in general because of this.
3-small-core languages tend to be more amenable to algorithmic improvement
4-algorithms trump optimization.
&gt; And there is another facet to the liability issue. If
&gt; SawStop did come to market and was proved effective in
&gt; preventing accidents, it might be easier for plaintiffs
&gt; to win lawsuits against manufacturers of traditional
&gt; saws, because juries might be more likely to return a
&gt; verdict against a manufacturer that chose not to implement
&gt; SawStop. That's the main reason, Gass believes, that the
&gt; big tool makers are refusing to deal with him. They want
&gt; his product to go away.

But, of course, it's too late to put that genie back into the bottle. Even if the entire industry unites in an effort to refuse this technology, that act alone could serve as excellent grounds for a lawsuit from anyone who loses a finger to a saw.

A friend of mine lost his thumb to a table saw last year.  Maybe I should show him this article ... if it were me, I'd seriously consider suing for failure to adopt this tech.
Lightroom for Linux would be good too.

Yes, he says,

&gt; If I am right, religion has no survival value for individual human beings, nor for the benefit of their genes

But he also says that religions real power comes in groups. But this isn't true.

Religion can give any individual hope or determination. I know some of the darkest times of my life, I got hope not through my church or some group of people related to religion, but rather through my own experience. It provided me, as an individual with a huge amount of "survival value".

I wonder how reddit's "figure-out-the-domain-of-the-link" algorithm works, since the front page says "When Google was Beta (google.com)" as of now, but the link clearly points to web.archive.org and not google.com. ;-)


That was my first thought exactly. However, the article appears to be aimed at users who may not necessarily be very technically proficient. While I could not work without LaTeX, it does have a steep learning curve for new users.
do the math.  1% of the US market is &lt;$2 million dollars.  They took in &gt;$1M of capital, and need to pay back out at around 10-20x to their investors, with a time horizon of about 2 years.  3% is about right.

Now, it would be interesting if some small saw company came to them and asked for a 1% royalty, which I would accept in their position.  Then the whole mess would start to fall apart for the big saw companies.

"How come God doesn't send colorful miracle-working prophets anymore?"

Y'know, I've always wondered about that too.  There's plenty of people who claim to be prophets running around today, but none of them are performing any miracles.  

By miracles, I mean things like parting the Red Sea or raising the dead.  The stuff that these current prophets are claiming as miracles are pretty pedestrian stuff: curing arthritis or winning the lottery.  Or they claim that they can use God's power to drive the "demons" out; it's all a bunch of magic tricks.

Yes there is.  The entire program consisted of doing tree transformations in order to construct a scheme program which is then executed.  In Scheme you can do that because programs are lists.  In Perl/Python/Ruby they're just strings.  I suppose you could do the same thing with some pretty wild string manipulation, or use one of those extension modules that allows you to mess with the interpreter's AST, but that's an awful lot of unnecessary effort.
Manual tampering, I suspect.  Drag your mouse over the link.  On all the others you see the destination.  On this one you see Reddit's tracking URL.
And no sooner do I post that than they fix it.
&gt; I believe you, but how does that refute Dawkins' argument? He's just arguing that religion has no /overall/ survival value for human beings.

To start off with, what do you mean by "overall"? If someone doesn't commit suicide because they have found hope in religion, that has directly had value to their survival. Or maybe someone is able to continue on with a very important project of theirs because of their strong faith, and that in turn leads to the survival of thousands? Again, its very valuable.

I just don't know where you can come to the conclusion that religion has no surival value to humans. In great tragedies or disasters, often the one thing that differentiates those who die and those who live are those who didn't give up and kept fighting. If religion is one of those impetesus that keeps them fighting, how has it done anything but help human beings to survive?

How many people survived in the gulags of Russia or the concentration camps of Nazi Germany simply because they had hope through their faith? You ever heard of Corrie Ten Boom? Many people have, but if you haven't, I'd recommend that you read up on her. Her story (she was a Jew in the concentration camps of Germany) would disprove Dawkins' idea in a heartbeat.

&gt; You also have to consider the number of people who are made thoroughly miserable by religion.

How many people have been made miserable by progress? I assure you that there are some people alive today who would have been better off living 500 years ago because their livelyhood wouldn't have been them being relegated to a factory where they do the same repetitive task for 10 hours a day for less than minimal wage.

Just because some people are made miserable by something doesn't mean that it has no inherent surivival value to humans.
This desperately needs a better headline.  This is really interesting material but it should be headlined "The Many Directions Of Time" or something like that.

I was wondering If anybody did - its a nice totally stupid idea...
January 31, 2006 adidas unveiled a new soccer footwear concept late last week in Germany which could have far-reaching ramifications for the world's fashion footwear and sporting footwear industries.
It is true that religion has an individual component that is not dependent on group interaction.  Much like yoga, or chess, or reading, it provides select individuals with a sense of well-being that they feel helps them in their lives.  Dawkins acknowledges that this is the case, as would most reasonable aetheists.
It is also true that when a bunch of people who do the same individual religion thing get together, the resulting groups are affected by their religion of choice.  Like many group activities, it does incredible damage to the world, both in terms of waste of resources and in terms of specific nastiness like religious war.  Every religion, without exception, has examples of a bunch of followers getting together and going killing in the name of their religion.  Some religions have a relatively small number of such examples, some, like Christianity and Islam, have a hell of a lot.  No honest religious person can deny any of this, although many religious persons will say that the people who did the nasty things were not "truly X", where X is their preferred religion.

I think the point of disagreement between you and Dawkins is that you have different opinions of the relative magnitude of you feeling good because you have religion and millions dying in religious conflict.
Why do you think that you were presented with a representative sample?

Dawkins actually argues that religion is a side-effect of a useful characteristic of kids: that they just believe whatever they are told.  
Arguing that science has been a net negative for the world is fairly hard, arguing that religion is a net negative would be rather easier, I imagine.
Incidentally, it would be interesting to see if the survival rate of religious people in very hard circumstances is higher than that of the non-religious.  If not, then it begs the question: why do anecdotes of non-religious survivors not get as much attention?  An uncharitable response would be that religious people have little else to hype about religion in general, but perhaps it is that religious things make better stories.
When Richard Feynman was dying of cancer, he had no late conversion to religion.  He accepted that his death was the end of him, and he met that death with a dignity that we often associate with religious people.  Why is his story not widely known?  Perhaps it really is that religious stories tell better.

That must be why no one is ever pressured to be straight these days, why there is never violence towards gays, and why there aren't any states trying to permanently ban unions between people of the same sex.  Oh wait.  Of course people trying to demonstrate their tolerance have latched onto this movie, but that doesn't mean that it didn't educate a few people along the way.
Also, homosexuality does not take advantage of people who cannot defend themselves.  Accepting homosexuality does not mean that we should accept lifestyles that do.
&gt; No honest religious person can deny any of this, although many religious persons will say that the people who did the nasty things were not "truly X", where X is their preferred religion.

I don't see why this isn't a valid explanation. If Christ taught "Love your enemies as yourself" and "Those who live by the sword will die by it", and someone who claims to be his follower does otherwise - then they aren't really following what he taught (ie, his religion) are they?

I think the question one has to ask oneself is wherever bmw is the authority on bmw topic - and hence has the right to be at the top of search results? And judging by the previous high ranki this site used to have, the answer seems to be yes. After all, doorway pages do not affect the page rank or the placing of pages; they only affect listed keywords and the ability of people to find you using a broader set of words.
The movie you request was done in 2004, starring Kevin Bacon, and it was called The Woodsman.  

It is still useful to have a movie like Brokeback Mountain, and it is extremely well-done, even if it were useless.
What you mean is distilled, not fermented.

&gt; Think about it. The central question for Dawkins is: "If a person is born with psychological tendencies which make them credulous enough to become relgious, will this increase their overall chance of survival". Dawkins answers YES to this question. However, there is a second question: "Does religious belief, in itself, increase the chance of a person's survival". The answer Dawkins gives to this question is NO. It doesn't matter that /some/ people have benefited from their beliefs. The question is whether more than 50% of religious people benefit from their beliefs.

So where are his stats to back this up if it comes down to a percentage number?

&gt; Fairly obviously, you have to consider whether the advantages of being religious outway the disadvantages (on average). Dawkins is quite reasonably suggesting that they don't. (Hence my remark that religion makes some people very miserable, or even leads to their deaths.)

Again are his stats to back that up? On average is a statistical term. It appears to me that Dawkins is observing from his ivory tower and making statements that he isn't really qualified to make.

Its easy when you are sitting in a comfy chair at home typing an article up to be read online. I wonder if Dawkins has bothered talking to actual people about this subject to come up with some kind of relevant survey as opposed to making a lot of statements without any real backing.

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply he said otherwise.  I just thought I'd save others from the long winded version.
It is certainly true that a government cannot make starting a business easy, but they sure can make it hard.  An entrepreneurial acquaintance of mine from Germany said that starting a business is hellaciously difficult there, and that this was a major factor in keeping some people who otherwise would start businesses from doing so.

Because GIMP is not l33t enough. It's the name and the warez scene that makes it essential for web-designers and other RGB-only people who don't even need half of what GIMP can do.

Also, how in the world can the article state-
&gt;It's also not really thought of as a "Windows" application in many shops. For many graphic pros, it's a Mac OS program.

-in one paragraph and-

It would have been nice if this guy had spoken up at the time.
In short: whether a killer follows christianity or not is beside the point, if he kills in its name.

In long:
This is a wonderful illustration of the single worst thing about religion, a highly contested superlative by any measure: The religion can never be blamed for anything.  It's always misguided followers of some other religion.

You say you are a Christian.  Eric Rudolph says he is a Christian.  You note that it says in a book( which you say contains the word of God) that killing people, which was at one point mostly ok, became a really bad thing sometime between 1AD and the widespread standardization of the bible.
You further note that Rudolph killed people, and that therefore you don't think he should be considered a Christian.  Rudolph begs to differ.  What to do?

There are a few choices available here: I can decide that yes indeed, you are correct, and a close textual analysis of  your book reveals that this guy is not in very good concert with the main character of the latter part of your book.  I should therefore call you a "christian", and this other guy a "dangerous kook".  This has the side effect of making part of our language directly dependent on a 3+ generation translation of a transcription of a bunch of oral history, but no matter.  The problem here is that now I, who have no interest in religion, have to referee for you religious types on who is what.  This is not so good.

Alternatively, I can say that both you and he fit nicely within the current popular definition of christian, and that English is defined not by etymology but by current standard usage.  I can then leave it to the people who identify as christians to either get togther on what it means, or to invent terms for themselves to differentiate, or to police themselves.

There is an intriguing logical fallacy at work here:  you have a set of values, and people who deviate from those values enough are said not to be following your religion.  Therefore, by definition, no one following your religion has ever murdered!  While it is regrettably true that some have temporarily strayed, gone on a murderous rampage, and then returned to grace, no practicing christian has ever killed a soul!

I think a more honest way to define "following christianity" is to call it about the standard way: if someone goes to church, says they are a christian, and such, then call them a christian.  If they then do nasty things, admit that a christian did nasty things.  Finally, if they do nasty things in the name of their religion, admit that they did nasty things in the name of their religion, and consider that as a negative to be weighed against the comfort you feel in dark times.

If a bunch of agnostics started going around and burning churches, mosques, and synagogues because they didn't want people worshipping, I would want to stop them, even though there is no real agnostic group or identity.  It is interesting that the religious, desipite their far greater cohesion, do not seem to feel the same way.

Hum.  Stats.  Shall we start listing religious wars that were religiously motivated, like the Crusades?  Or shall we instead start with more intra- than inter-state actions, like the Inquisition?  Or perhaps we should stay more current, like with the effects of Roman Catholic prohibition of birth control, and its effects in Latin America?  Intelligent design?  Terrorism in the US against abortion clinics?  Economic expenditure on religious artifacts?  What's your pick?

If all of that is just too close to home, we can pick on other religions-even dead ones, so as not to offend.
I should have said "communists, nationalists/fascists, and racists" instead.  I used the word atheists because I wanted to emphasize that religion had basically no part in motivating the vast majority of the crimes against humanity committed in the twentieth century -- which outnumber such casualties from all prior human history by a large margin.

&gt; How is nationalism and racism distinct from any particular religion?

Because it's simplistic and misleading to say that Fascist Nationalism and Communism are "like religions" when they, and not organized religion, are responsible for unprecedented level of organized brutality over the last hundred years.

All the really nasty, murderous ideologies of late have been about focusing group hatred by encouraging people to give up  their individual volition in the service of a collective -- usually the state.  Violent Islamism the the *first* murderous self-abnegating ideology I can think of that substitutes a religious creed for a political state.  **So it would be more profitable for us to ask how atrocity-committing Muslim hatred is like atrocity-committing Communist or Nazi hatred, rather than asking how Muslim fundamentalists are like Christian fundamentalists.**

actually, it need not be the case that 50% benefit-it just needs to be a net positive.  If 1% benefit a great deal, and the rest recieve no benefit, it is net positive. 

Interestingly, if a strategy helps you a small amount but hurts others a lot more at the same time, it would be the correct choice for each individual, particularly if the harm is mostly centered outside your immediate group.

Perhaps a more charitable way to respond to jesusphreak is that the stats are likely to be bad for his argument, and that Dawkins sees a plausible argument for why credulity is a good thing in kids, but not necessarily a good argument for religion being helpful in general.

very good point.  I'll remember that.  One thing I forgot to note-chez is actually among the slower schemes, isn't it?  This guy might have done better to use MzScheme, which has a truly excellent numerical tower.
Your headline is sensational and misleading compared to what's actually in the story.
This article does not indicate if the guy knew, prior to Powell's speech, that the info was wrong.  

In other words, is he saying he was in on a hoax, or that he was an unknowing participant?

Guess I'll have to watch NOW.

This is the key:

&gt; I was also told that while GIMP's functionality may rival Photoshop's, how you get there is very different.

There's no doubting that Photoshop is extremely unintuitive to a novice. Even moving around and resizing layers is bizarre, compared with the grab/drag philosophy of Powerpoint.

But the fact is that *everyone is used to it*. Learn Photoshop, learn the quirks, then it makes sense. Even if GIMP *were* a more sensible arrangement of the tools, a Photoshop person knows the steps to create a particular effect, and they just aren't there in GIMP. It's just close enough to be frustrating.

And hence, WINE + Photoshop.
Shit floats to the top.

I'm thinking about the kinds of people that start wars for oil profits.

By the way, it was the right thing to do when the inventor "ate his own dogfood", brave too :)

Oh, and I really urge everyone to buy only this kind of tablesaw from now on. The guy from the story started his own company and: "The company knows of at least five other amputations that have been averted." It's also a great way to stick it to "the man".
I like the ! on the end, a tribute to one of their competitors perhaps?
I wonder, does Reddit incorporate the number of comments in determining how high a website is ranked? Maybe it should, it's something I always scan for when selecting articles to read... (lots of comments means it's "controversial" or at least an article worth discussing)
It is not clear that it is even done all that cheaply, you have to replace the stopping mechanism after each use as I read the website and I am guessing you may need to replace the blade. However, I'll stick with my conspiracy theory, as soon as I saw the video I guessed it could be done using the same technology for a touch lamp. And any engineer can imagine 100 ways to stop a spinning blade fast. First, you have to want to do it!
Um, people do this all the time and Google axes them all the time and none of them get this publicity. Ok, well wordpress got publicity too. But I don't think it's usually a benefit for the pageshrunk website.
He just used Scheme to design his algorithm, which he rewrote in C. It doesn't really matter how fast his Scheme implemnetation is.
There were cheap pre-duck-hunt games that made this more obvious. A VHS tape played images where the targets had flashing elements, and you'd get a gun with a little LCD that displayed how many times you shot a flashing target.

So I figured duck hunt out on my own by watching the screen carefully. Aren't I smart.
duh.  good point.  I wonder what the difference in speed was between his final C version and the scheme would have been?
Religion is created to explain the unexplainable, therefore it must be accepted on faith, by definition (since it's for something unexplainable).

The natural result of this is that when different religions have different explanations for the same thing, the respective sides go to war against each other.

Few people have the ability to genuinely doubt their own belief system.
Thanks jesusphreak, from an atheist it's nice to hear that interpretation coming from a Christian, since it seems that way to me too. 

Are the stories in the Old Testament considered a basis for understanding Christianity, or is it the stories in the New Testament that Christians use to guide them on this issue? I ask because having read some of the Old Testament there are passages where God at various times encourages murder, sacrifice, and supports war. This seems to change in the New Testament with the teachings of Christ.
to me who's never read this article, and i expect others as well, this is new. i'm happy for them to be posted, and if they climb in the rankings other people are too. mod the story down if you find it old.

Code compiled with the Chez compiler is very fast.
The Chez compiler is somewhat expensive, there
is a freely available interpreter though - which
is actually very fast.

For numerical computations in Scheme it seems Gambit
is popular - for amazingly fast code use Stalin, but
be prepared for *long* compile times.

thanks : )  someone who actually answers a question for a change.
Though I know mzscheme has a C compiler and probably others.  so it would have been interesting to see how his C version compared to the automatically generated one.
I don't know TCL, so please elaborate.
Yes, any idiot could have figured it out just by playing the game. Nothing too amazing here.
Ugly reasoning. 

And why couldn't one ask those questions to people who condone heterosexual love as well? 

Is this an argument for why pedophilia should become de-stymatised, or an argument for why all love should be made taboo? I'm guessing neither, and am struggling to see the point.
My cousins and I used to play Duck Hunt in a room that had a big mirror in it.  We would shoot the gun at the TV's reflection.  Worked just fine!

BMW.DE behaviour was bad, but the unbiased data is that now people
searching for "bmw germany" are no longer getting the right result.

1) In this particular case is not clear if google is helping users to find the right site.

2) I think search egines should have algorithms that are able to compute
how search results are returned without human attendance of the
form "Hey, this site is using bad stuff, remove it from the index".

In a prefect world the algorithm for search results should be at the
same time public and impossible to cheat, like belived secure crypto
algorithms. If this is not possible at least I think it is a good idea
to write an algorithm and let it run without humans verdicts.

Removing sites from the index by hand is for search engine like
all that ugly conditional expressions used in spaghetti code to handle
special stuff in the code flow ;)
Commentary on Wolf Singer's article "The Brain - An Orchestra Without a Conductor"
i like this research and this story. but, these two contradictory paragraphs bother me.

|Will you be able to get a copy of the Java-based version |of the Image Science Group's applications? Probably not. |One of the dilemmas of this type of software is that the |more widespread the distribution, the more chance forgers |will exploit it to their advantage. Police organizations |and news media outlets will likely get access to the |application, but he's still unsure of how far he will |extend distribution beyond that.
|
|And although Farid charges a fee when asked to serve as a |consultant, the software will be made freely available |under an open-source license. He doesn't even have plans |to form a company around his work. A significant amount of |the research, after all, was funded by federal grants. 

An open-source license means that it has no restriction on who may use it, correct? Or am I wrong on this. Certainly it wouldn't be GPL.
And indeed, they were [using Python](http://reddit.com/info?id=182n) even then, to handle subscriptions to their email list.
George Deutsch, 24-year-old journalism major turned NASA public affairs officer (who also happens to be a Bush appointee), says that the Big Bang is "not proven fact; it is opinion ... It is not NASA's place [to] make a declaration such as this about the existence of the universe that discounts intelligent design by a creator."
That's a general issue, and genreally unanswerable by any search engine; people's critera vary. I certainly expect the BMW site when I search for BMW.
The people who get their site listed first purely by hacking the algorithm that puts it there - with content that no human will ever see.

More so than the search engine that tries to be smart about what pages it lists as most relevant and relies on people not being sneaky bastards about it.

Google can only do so much to prevent that, so a little motivation like this doesn't hurt. They'll probably be back soon anyway...

As to the indexing - that's how that works. Bots don't execute javascript, that's only logical. If you violate accessibility standards by not having the actual content in (X)HTML, it's not going to get indexed. If they know web design well enough to fool google, they know web stuff well enough to realize that.
Sadly, we no longer seem to be able to get Google! monthly updates anymore. Hmmm, wonder how we'll keep up-to-date with what they're doing :)

You don't geddit, Google's content is a list of millions ranked by amounts of links.

Reddit's content is a list of things ranked by reddit reader's opinions. The opinions matter, not whether it's from a long time ago or not. The year doesn't matter, the word "new" in this case is about if it's NEW TO REDDIT READERS.

You picked the wrong meaning of new, change the way you think about "new articles" or stop bothering us with your wrong idea about it please.

It's true that Reddit's motto needs to be changed because emergent behaviour of Reddit rules created a site that doesn't filter according to the date of the article. However, you should have seen that and said: "obviously the motto is outdated but what reddit has emerged into is useful to the readers."

Instead, you basically said: "Reddit's motto is ... so we have to change the whole behaviour of the site even though this behaviour is obviously good for the readers."

I'll say it again, you chose wrong, you should have kept the behaviour and discarded the motto.

Why did you make this decision? Is it because "Reddit's motto" has more authority in your mind than what the others have commented on your first post? Don't take language so literally, it's just a fairly accurate representation of what the writer meant.
Why is there a russian post on here? SPEAK ENGLISH OR SHUTUP!
That theory makes sense.  since we tend to think in language, it would make sense that we encode memories in language, so if we have no language, we have no way to encode.

Dawkins seems to have spent a lot of time thinking about this judging from all his publications about this.

What would you expect him to do to make him "qualified" in this matter? Should he study theology? Become a priest? Or are all non-religious people simply disqualified from arguing about religion (which would mean only pro-religious arguments are qualified)?
I recently (4 months ago) gave up both tv and videogames.  I've started exercising and reading a lot more.  I started taking care of my finances.  My internet intake seems to actually be gradually going down as well.

I wish I'd done it years ago.  I still download stargate and bsg episodes, and the occasional bullshit or red dwarf episode, but overall I'm a bit happier than I was.
Actualy we have a way to "encode" memories with no language. Emotions and sensorium modals (think sight, sound, smell, touch). But finding ways to recall without languages handy handles, that is a diffrent matter altogether.

But who am I telling you these things? I am certenly no expert.
He took 5,000 words to say this:

Religion exists because children believe what their parents tell them, right or wrong.

That's Malcolm Gladwell's argument from *Tipping Point*. Did you just read that?
I can't be positive, but I expect the Scanline clips are (at least some of them) partially assembled using "actual" footage. Kind of like water in an animated film... artists draw a handful of whitecap sprites and then map those over a surface to fake it.

Whereas the video in the story isn't just accurate in terms of behaviour, it's also *really close* in terms of the light and refraction. (although I agree with it looking a little jello...)
agreed. It is just a matter of starting. You end up having a good amount of files that you reuse and reuse.
Note that G. W. Bush too has committed perjury.  Google 'funeralgate.'  Though he has not been tried or found guilty, there is clear unquestionable evidence.  The worse scandal is that thanks to Republican cronyism he will never be tried, and justice will never be served.

Interesting, it isn't necessarily a solid mathematical formula, but gives you a good framework for thinking about how efficiently you're spending your time on various tasks.  Probably too simplistic if you're someone who actually creates formulas for determining productivity though.
http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=An_Index_to_Creationist_Claims
True, but a "solid mathematical formula" probably would be overkill when it comes to deciding if I should change my oil myself or have the service center do it.
I should have said "his chosen culture" perhaps. He consistently refers to Western culture as something "we" own. He may have a Muslim name, but it seems he identifies more as a Westerner, which is perfectly fine.

I don't read the article the same way you do. His agenda is that the West should not apologize for itself, across a very broad scope. This is great when he means contemporary freedom of expression; not so great when we're talking about British rule in India.
Yes I think that's correct, the open source definition states that an open source license:

&gt; shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

and,

&gt; must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

But it does not mean that it will be distributed to everyone. It could be that he plans to give it to certain organizations, who wouldn't then distribute the software to other parties (though if they wanted to redistribute the software I don't think he would be able to stop them).

It is odd that the second paragraph states that his program would be "freely available", that makes me think that he would be offering it to other people along with those organizations.
And he's right!

Jewish tradition explicitly says, teach these things to your children.  (E.g., Psalm 145, if I recall off the top of my head.)  Professor Dawkins just figured out something that was in the Bible all the time.  :-)

He puts a different angle on it, of course.

As a Christian, I find a perhaps surprising appreciation in Dawkins' articles.  A lot of what many Christians do is hypocritic, unloving, uncaring, making up religious cruft, and totally against the Bible.

Christians claim that the most important thing to do is to love God with all of your heart, and love your neighbor as yourself.  My goodness, if we all actually DID that, Professor Dawkins would have a much harder time refuting the existence of God.
Hillel's quote is better, too bad he isn't God.

Now, as for Islam I just came back to this subject today, and I'm now confused--

42:40 "The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto; *but* if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for He loveth not those who do wrong."

So, which one is it?

To decide for yourself, here is [a page by a Muslim](http://www.answering-christianity.com/golden_rule_lie.htm) -- rather heavily biased but you can scroll down to see his defense.
Why didn't he "adopt this tech" by replacing his saw with a SawStop saw?  They were available before his accident.

No manual tampering one way or the other... It's just a regex that fell through the cracks.
There's no conflict between condoning some behaviour and condemning other behaviour. So far, that's the point I've understood you've been trying to make. 

I assume that you condone some things, and condemn certain other things. I can safely assume this because there really is no other way of *being*.

You imply that if I support homosexual love, therefore unless I am to be found out as a hypocrite, I must support *all* kinds of love. 

We all place a marker between what is acceptable, and not acceptable. My definition of acceptable, when it comes to love, is for the people to be of the age of consent, and for the relationship to not be damaging, or otherwise abusive. So I support homosexual love between consensual adults as I do heterosexual love between consensual adults. 

This is the prevailing thought in enlightened societies, what you disparagingly describe as 'fashion' is in fact a great respect for the dignity of other people, and an understanding that consensual adult love is not something to be feared, demonised, or ridiculed. 

I'm not motivated to support homosexual love because I wish to be seen as 'tolerant' by other people. I'm motivated because I have respect and consideration for the people I live alongside.
Two documentation projects emerged this month to spearhead a new push in the Web 2.0 era for simplicity. 

Project No. 1
The Dreamsbox (http://www.dreamsbox.com) Project seeks to document the world's dreams, allowing for anonymous posting of dreams along with the creations of personal dream diaries. Simple functions include a unique rating and search 
system.

Project No. 2
The Sinsbox (http://www.sinsbox.com) Project seeks to document the world's sins  and secrets, allowing for anonymous confessions in addition for submissions of expressional artwork. Simple functions also include a unique rating and search system.

Both projects place huge emphasis on simple technologies moving complex ideas and social functions. While the sites are indeed simple in design, they are pushing heavily on traffic and making a good argument for simple UI and purpose in the Web 2.0 era of huge and complex web projects. These two projects prove that simple ideas move traffic rather than complex technologies.

Once again, life imitates science fiction.  Specifically, Oshii's Ghost in the Shell.  I can think of several other places where 'tracer rounds' didn't mean phosphorous trails following the path of the bullet.

Two documentation projects emerged this month to spearhead a new push in the Web 2.0 era for simplicity. 

Project No. 1
The Dreamsbox (http://www.dreamsbox.com) Project seeks to document the world's dreams, allowing for anonymous posting of dreams along with the creations of personal dream diaries. Simple functions include a unique rating and search 
system.

Project No. 2
The Sinsbox (http://www.sinsbox.com) Project seeks to document the world's sins  and secrets, allowing for anonymous confessions in addition for submissions of expressional artwork. Simple functions also include a unique rating and search system.

Both projects place huge emphasis on simple technologies moving complex ideas and social functions. While the sites are indeed simple in design, they are pushing heavily on traffic and making a good argument for simple UI and purpose in the Web 2.0 era of huge and complex web projects. These two projects prove that simple ideas move traffic rather than complex technologies.

You do need to replace the bade; the brake stops the blade by slamming a block of aluminum in to it. I don't think it really matters though. Let's say it costs $100 every time this thing stops. It's probably less. How much is your finger worth? Would you let me cut off one of your fingers for $100?
Build something foolproof and they build a better fool. There will probably always be dirty tricks, and I think this is the best way to deal with people who use them. The purpose of delisting isn't to improve search results in the short term, but to improve them in the long term by punishing abusive behavior.
Former photoshop person here.  First, photoshop is good, I think it is one the best packages I have ever used (at least PS6.0).  I have finally converted to GIMP, mainly because I kept losing the PS CDs and I have many machines now, and I wouldnt dare pay $500 for any software.  It makes sense to go opensource (even on win32).

Now, GIMP's interface is still not up to PS's.  Things just flow when using Photoshop.  The GIMP way is really NOT broken, but it just feels nicer in Photoshop, for some reason.

And, that single document interface in GIMP is just plain annoying, I don't care what anybody says.

Other than that, I will still use it, but I understand the article above.

Here it is: **[drinking the kool-aid](http://reddit.com/info?id=ztu)**. It's long, but fascinating.
20 MPG to 30 MPG?! There's no way that there's that much inefficiency in an automatic transmission.

A standard transmission is only a few MPG more efficient than  an automatic at highway speeds. And a standard transmission is about as efficient as a transmission can get. It's a direct mechanical link between the engine and the wheels. So where is this magical 50% increase in efficiency coming from?

you can criticize a link, but you have to be respectful.  the comment you just made is a good counter-example: "do gooder types" is not respectful, and neither is your use of sarcasm.

it's easy to be respectful when you're making a positive comment on something you agree with, but much harder when you're disagreeing.
Not quite - The statusbar text is set to link straight through to web-archive. Then, when you click the link, the mousedown event (or whatever that is in javascript) changes the URL to the reddit tracking URL, which redirects you.

So if you click on the link and then come back, or don't complete the click, when you mouseover you see the reddit.com tracking link. You then have to refresh in order for the link to be reset.

Sorry if that didn't make sense. I'm drunk. You and jajvirta are talking about two different things. He's talking about the "(google.com)", not the statusbar text. And that is due to a ~faulty regex, like spez (himself) pointed out. And spez hain't fixed it yet.
more on ants, according to i2p.net:

&gt;the algorithm does not scale well at all - if the application wants to speak with a particular peer it ends up doing a broadcast search or random walk (though if they are lucky enough for that to succeed, the antnet routing should optimize that found connection). This means that while these networks can work great at small scales, they are not suitable for large networks where someone wants to get in touch with another specific peer. That does not mean that there is no value in these systems, just that their applicability is limited to situations where their particular issues can be addressed.

Seems to be more about the guy than about the actual device and how it works. Even with the direct link of a manual transmission, I could picture there being some way to improve efficiency, but 20-30 MPG? Seems unlikely...

Pope John Paul in his speech to the Pontifical Academy of Science in 1981 stated that:               

"The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its makeup, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in terms of cosmology in use at the time of the writer[1]."

Previous to that address, the Vatican II council introduced many aspects of modern science in church life in the mid-1960s. 

Yet many Christians ignore the Vatican. I think Mel Gibson is one of them : ).

How did you come up with the idea that God didn't exist? Rather than mod this comment down I challenge someone to actually prove to me that God doesn't exist.
The use of a particular Religion depends on whether it's actually true. If Jesus really exists and really is the Son of God like he claimed than Christianity is incredibly useful in that it tells you what you need to know.

Congress smelled the winds of political turmoil and shut the above-water program down, but doubtlessly, the executive branch (while surely disappointed) used the more conspicuous program to guage public and legislative reaction to the NSA's domestic-international eavesdropping program, already over a year old.

Don't fail to notice the **Total Information Awareness** office's last minute name change to the **Terrorist Information Awareness** project. It failed to save their ass. The administration and their Fox News followers are already attempting the same game with the NSA program. Are the scared sheep frightened enough to follow?

Well said. I found the article very well written and argued. Of course athiests will not find anything here to cause them to become Catholics (or followers of any other religion), but this article is not written for them. This article goes back to what I was taught as a young child, that faith is something that one believes *without* proof. Trying to prove the existence of God by the Intelligent Design argument is an insult to both scientifically minded people, and people of faith.

Interesting. I sumbitted the article. At first I agreed with it, but then I wondered if he isn't asking the impossible. How can I justify doing something because I love my parents, if you think all love is for suckers, let alone justify my doing something out of love for God? It seems like society is equipped to ask itself, "how can we do this?" and have a rational dialogue, but not to ask "what should we do?" since different people have different aims, and those aims might be permanently conflicting without agreement about what constitutes "the good." 

If you're right though, then his main point is about trying to convince non-believers to help you out of their own self-interest. And that I do agree with. Hmm, needs more thought and coffee.

I'll prove god doesn't exist when you prove there isn't a sofa in orbit around saturn with paisley upholstery and tatty arms. When you make something up and start announcing that it is fact, the burden of proof is on you.
The burden of proof is on the believer. This is a common fallacy called 'shifting the burden of proof'. The believer asserts that something is true unless disproven. It should be obvious that this is not a rational position to take.

Yes, and suggesting that RSS is a failed technology because it hasn't gained traction yet with television news consumers (sheeple) isn't a very useful thought.  The fact that not all consumers are going to aggregate a bunch of feeds anytime soon  (or possibly never) has little to do with the power of syndicating content over XML.

*...one should never start a company to be bought, but because you really believe in it.*

I think this is a false dichotomy.  Galbraith assumes that if you found your startup with the intention of getting bought (a good strategy at the low end of the spectrum he talks about--$10M), you can't possibly "believe", which I interpret to mean high founder commitment to the technology and the implementation thereof.

This has been disproven with the recent round of acquisitions by Yahoo!, particularly del.icio.us.  Founding a startup with the intention of getting bought seems, in my limited understanding of business, to clarify the commitment of everybody working to make the startup a success by creating a well-defined goal and a limit on how long certain commitments might last, not to mention avoiding selling out to VC cash.

I have the feeling that /a certain company/ has adopted a different versioning scheme:

alpha: all but unusable

beta: may crash your system anytime

release candidate(s): beta with some of the bugs removed

final release: can be used for testing (still lots of bugs)
sp1: first almost usable version

sp2: skip that, this one's at least as bad as the "beta"

sp3: first "stable" version.

This, IMHO, is much worse than declaring something as "work in progress": it's a hoax. But who cares? *sigh*
This is the kind of faux-responsible argument that atheists make when they want to sound reasonable and still make sure that their position wins.

&lt;I rewrote the following for clarity&gt;

There is no way to prove the existence of god.  **There is also no way to disprove the existence of god**.  If you don't believe me, google up "Alvin Plantinga" -- he's a philosophy prof at Notre Dame -- and read a few of his papers.

Shifting the burden of proof to the believer is thus a way to make believers lose the argument -- which isn't what this kind of discussion is supposed to be about.

In particular, your proposition that 'it should be obvious that this is not a rational position to take' is not an argument.  It's a statement of your opinion.

That makes you no better than all the other crazed believers.

The book linked on [this page](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/info-theory/course.html) is a pretty good reference on information theory and contains a chapter called "Why have sex?" -- that explains why exchanging genetic material is evolutionarily advantageous.

The greatest loss in modern cars is due to fundamental inefficiencies in heat engines.  The maximum possible efficiency in a heat engine is determined by the temperatures of the cold and hot thermal resevoirs between which the engine operates.  For gasoline engines, this efficiency is somewhere around 30%.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine for details.

Dark matter does not exist, it is a contrivince formed to explain data in terms of general relativity which does not fit the model that general relativity implies.  Check the model, not the data.

The article gives two very good, valid arguments as to why this technology has not been licensed:

&gt; "The primary problem," he said, "was an unacceptably high rate of false trips of the braking device when cutting wet, green, or pressure-treated lumber."

If I had to replace my blade when I cut my finger, yes, I'd be ok with that.  If there was wood I could not cut without it going off or if it just decided to go off at certain time, that would certainly lessen my opinion of it significantly.  

&gt; The industry, Lanier added, is also wary of the fact that even when the device works, the user still walks away with an injury. "Manufacturers discovered that, depending on the accident scenario and the type of blade used, a user even with a properly functioning SawStop-equipped table saw still could sustain a very severe injury,"

Is a half cut-off finger much cheaper to treat or less painful than fully cut off finger?  

Instead of pissing and moaning that no one will license their technology, they should be selling kits so people can equip their current saws with it.  There's plenty of people who would buy it, I'm sure.  More importantly, they could gain the in-the-field data that would show how much less the cost of injuries being prevented would actually be.  (Or they would find out that it really doesn't help enough to justify the cost of running their business.)

Speculation: about 20% of Cryptonomicon could be snipped out, packaged into articles, and promoted successfully on reddit.  That's not too shabby for a book with 900+ pages.

Personally, I like the author's Way of Capitalization to humorously promote Certain Objects to proper-noun status.
Can someone explain to me. You are working with a tool having an exposed saw blade that revolves hundreds av turns a second. It is used to cut thing that is a lot tougher than a finger.

You use it eventhough there are other tools that are more safe, probably because it is faster.

How can you sue the manufacturer for this? It is not like there are any hidden threats.

The analogy with the car industry is not valid. Volvo made it self a very good name by building safe cars. There was no US government that forced them do it. Volvo was perhaps not a pioneer but they certainly sold a lot to safe seeking parents with small children.

Dead link. :(
Well, you are a believer. Rationality will not sway you, since 'god' is by definition conventiently irrational. Fair enough. I am a hard atheist - the facts combined with the scientific method lead me to the conclusion that god does not exist.

&gt; for now, either position is equally justifiable given the right set of a priori assumptions.

No, those positions are not equally justifiable. First of all, believers conveniently phrase the concept of 'god' in such a way that it is not open to enquiry, as you yourself concede. You might as well say that froobles are not snortly, and it would make just as much sense. Note that it was not always this way - just a few hundred years of scientific progress have pushed the 'god' concept into this dark corner, as various claimed magical aspects of gods have been disproven by observation of the facts.

Secondly, I would also like to point out that, if by your account both positions are equally justifiable, then you must believe that the existence of any deities from the Olympians to Xenu are just as justifiable as the existence of your particular deity. That, at least, should give you some pause.

None of this arguing, before or after this post, will change your mind, but I am hopeful that in the future we will find a way of at least containing these regressive thought patterns. The best way, of course, is to stop these memes (ah, our friend Dawkins!) from appearing in children in the first place, because they are certainly hard to get rid of.

What do they mean by "can be used in labs?"
Well, I think we should stop wasting people's time by testing them for dangerous diseases because the vast majority of them are usually fine amirite?
Well, I agree that it was dumb of them to allow that grammatical error in an article criticising bad grammar and poor writing skills.

But that error doesn't trump the assertion that the state of business writing is abominable.  It's the same quality of English in the hard sciences and especially law (try reading a large selection of legal briefs if you don't believe me).

*...before we criticize the shorthand many corporate employees use to get some actual work done*

That's a bit disingenuous.  Grammatical indifference or ignorance is actually an impediment to getting "some actual work done"--the article demonstrated that shorthand or IM-type "writing" actually *prevents* more work from getting done because it causes confusion and shoddy communication as well as creating repeated messages, email, and meetings.
&gt; It didn't happen, of course. Hindus may consider it odious to use cows as food, but they do not resort to boycotts, threats, and violence when non-Hindus eat hamburger or steak. They do not demand that everyone abide by the strictures of Hinduism and avoid words and deeds that Hindus might find upsetting. The same is true of Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons: They don't lash out in violence when their religious sensibilities are offended. They certainly don't expect their beliefs to be immune from criticism, mockery, or dissent.

Au contraire, Islamofacist is a meaningless term, a cheap attempt to conjoin Islam with facism, one of the western world's taboos. Islamonazi is another cryptonomical play. The irony of course is that facism and its close relative nazism were European and western in conception and mythos. It just doesn't transfer outside the culture.

Legally, it was right to remove him from office.  But morally, and from the point of view of common decency, I think it was totally unreasonable.  No man should have to testify about his sex life, or any aspect of his personal life for that matter, unless it is the subject of a criminal investigation.  It wasn't affecting his ability to do his job, and he didn't commit a crime until he lied about the non-crime.  Now isn't that just ridiculously perverse?
The 'Big Bang' is just a theory?  I'm shocked, *shocked*, I tell you!

What a waste of bandwidth.  The dictionary on my desk contains this definition of the word *theory*:

*A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena*

So if NASA or anyone else adds the word "theory" to The Big Bang, it's actually an admission that BB is a widely accepted explanation of the origins of the universe.  But admitting this theory is widely accepted does not make it provable or fact; calling BB a theory actually encourages science by allowing other theories to be explored instead of shutting down further inquiry on scientific "fact."

Worked fine for me.
Muslims have no right or reason to complain about any of this, because *it never happened!* Yeah, that's right, I'm denying that offensive cartoons about Mohammed were ever published. There is no evidence of any of this, just as there was never a holocaust (more appropriately called shoah, btw.), as the recently elected Iranian prime minister claims.

Tolerance is a two-way street. There must not be tolerance of utter intolerance. Fanatics of any type must be kept in check.

On a more detailed level, there is no such thing as "Muslims" as a proxy for radical Islamists or sexually frustrated, angry men, just as not every American is a creationist, fundamentalist Christian. In Tehran youths party *underground*, because it's illegal, and they want to live a similar life to what people in the freer world are living. Unfortunately, Iran, and many other Arab (but also non-Arab) countries have a structural disconnect between what the majority of reasonable people (including, very importantly, women) want and what those who hold power decide is true and good for people. It's simply called totalitarianism, oppression, fascism, dictatorship, etc. Name it what you will, pick whatever shade, but that's the core of the problem.
Isn't fascism about a lack of freedom?  It might have been an idea that was first implemented and understood in Europe, but doesn't mean it can't travel to other parts of the world.  Ideas can be adopted anywhere, for good or bad.
I agree. In the article itself, it makes mention that the children can "remember" and properly identify the  decoy toys.

Now, someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but don't these count as childhood memories?

With my mother's help, I have identified that I remember as far back as about 18 months old. Of course I don't remember words about those memories... i didn't know any! But, being able to describe a house I lived in before I was two counts for something, right?

This is the worst theory yet. Please continue the variations of development in the  hypothalamus.

I had a friend once who, in college, was trying to recall a specific equation, but couldn't. As it turns out, he had learned it in spanish, and had to recall it in spanish to proceed with the calculation. This seems to indicate a side-note to the article's evaluation of memory and language.
I thought the reputation system took care of it. If you mod down the submissions they won't get much weight. Perhaps a spammer like this could be banned automatically once they have a certain level of negatively-modded articles.

Islamofacist is a *perfectly* applicable term, as the Islamist and the Nazis are perfect bedfellows.

* Both have a burning hatred of the Jewish people.

* Both are fond of using bullying tactics to get their way.

* Both employ scapegoating "the other", to stir their followers into action.

* Nazism had "Mein Kampf", a rambling, logic-impaired screed preaching hatred for non-Aryans and written by a crazy man.  The Islamists have the "Koran", a rambling, logic-impaired screed preaching hatred for non-believers and written by a man claiming to be God's spokesman.

* Hitler and his followers routinely insisted that all they wanted was peace.  Islamists routinely insist that Islam is a religion of peace. 

So, what really is the difference?  

Maybe instead of saying Bush = Hitler, we ought to be saying Muhammed = Hitler?

This author is full of shit. His first and last paragraph make sense (Free speech is good), and everything in between is just western asskissing.

Give me a break, we may not have invented it but we damn sure profited off it. I don't see why he had to go into how Western culture is better then Islamic, it just doesn't prove any points. Yes freedom of speech is good, these cartoons prove that by creating a lot of discussion, but saying that Western culture is the best there ever has been on earth? I don't think that helps anything.

This is like saying Freud discovered that people use their hands to grab things.

Possibly if you hatched yesterday the lucid portions of this might seem new.

Compared to Ruby and Python, Lisp has the following advantages:

* Programs can more easily manipulate their own structure because the program is written directly the parse tree.
* Macros. Ruby's blocks can do some of what macros do, but not all because they're just splicing in a block of code. Yield is used in about the same way as CL's ",@" sigil. For more information, search for symbol macros, reader macros and variable capture.
* Speed. Common Lisp is usually compiled to machine code, and Scheme can be compiled to just about anything (machine code, C, Java bytecode, .NET bytecode).
* Your choice of object systems - name an OOP feature; it's probably been written in Lisp.

Compared to Python, Ruby and Lisp have:

* Non-broken anonymous functions. (I'm probably going to get flamed)
* Macros (Lisp) or blocks (Ruby).
I also can't speak for the rest of my fellow water-buyers, but I tend to buy bottled water because I'm thirsty. (And there's no water fountains around, or I'm getting onto an airplane and would like more than the little sippy cups, or I'm going to play a sport and forgot to bring a water bottle from home, or, or...)

Seems like the author is going out on a very long limb in assuming that all, or even most, consumers are being "duped" about the "health benefits of bottled water". I mean, it's *water*, for pete's sake. Next up: "A startingly majority of johns are duped about prostitutes' sexual attraction to them"
Isn't that teen Vanilla Ice?
The question is whether you ignore anamolies in your data set and continue to search for empirical support for a theory, explaining away mis-match between empirical data and predictive theory with new particles which have yet to be explained.  Or, do you re-examine theory and see that there could be a logical explanation for observed data that does not match the current theory.  In this case I give the benefit of the doubt to the researchers working on dark matter as it is a fairly young idea, and deserves proper consideration, however, there are competing viewpoints, so that tag-line is essentially false, it could read "researchers who continue to believe in the theory of general relativity as posited by einstein, all agree that dark matter must exist for the theory to be valid."  Otherwise, as the article states, there wouldn't be enough gravity to keep things from flying apart.
for an alternative view go here:

http://www.stanford.edu/~afmayer/

I happen to think that this modification is a lot more logical than some of the dark matter explanations.  This theory is not proven, by any means, it is only a theory and could well turn out to be wrong.  I simply disagree with the willingness to overlook many of the well known anamolous phenomena in gravitational field theory
I think the high negative rank of those articles counts as having prevented that. I've never seen **any** of those because they were immediately demoted in to oblivion by the people who watch the new page.
Mon ami, of course is not a meaningless term. Instead of one crazy leader, muslims have one crazy book written by one crazy person.

Apart from the work being done in static typing, most language design work seems to be done in Scheme. Therefore, it looks as though it's going to stay 12 years ahead of everything else.

That isn't to say it's going to be 12 years better than everything else. Just that the good ideas you see in 12 years will have been tried first in Scheme. And the bad ideas you don't see in 12 years will also have been tried in Scheme.
I'll second that. This entire situation is ridiculous. The muslim world is going bonkers *for absolutely no reason, whatsoever, at all*.

Let's have a look. 

- I *may* publish cartoons that make fun of Jesus, the Pope, and our Lord Himself. I may *not* publish cartoons that make fun of Mohammed, Allah, or *anyone* who calls himself a muslim, or anyone who is in any way or manner associated with a muslim.

- I *may* call the Bible a children's book full of invented stories, and crappy ones at that. I may *not* say the same of the Koran.

- I *may* say that buddists are all just stupid jerks. I may *not* say that muslims are just brainless suckers. Well, actually I *may* say that -- it's just that the very next day a dozen heavily armored folks will kidnap me from the street and decapitate me.

- It is perfectly OK to burn a US, Danish, or German flag. As it is perfectly OK to burn a Bush manequin or a copy of the Bible. It is, however, *not* OK to burn a Sunni flag, a puppet of Ayatollah Khomeini, or a copy of the Koran.

- Heck, I *may* even say "fuck Jesus" and "God is dead". But I may *not* say "fuck Mohammed" and "Allah does not exist".

How come?
tell me your opinion then?
From the website:

Actions of *a few?* Yeah, right. Something tells me those *few* far outnumber these self-appointed moderates.

In this case, language may have been the only remaining neurological pathway he had to access that memory.

What about when mikaelhg or someone says something doesn't exist and announces that it is fact?

Being a Norwegian, I have followed the development in this case avidly. I must say it gives me great relief to see moderate muslims putting up an apology like this.

I will defend personal freedoms with my life, and the Arab people will have to swallow down its anger and accept our freedom of press. Yet conflicts have more than two sides, and it is obvious that we have offended the Muslim population gravely.

I care little whether moderate muslims are in majority. The fact that they dare speak up at all is enough for me. Remember that the Arab population is completely foreign to the personal freedoms we have in the West. A Norwegian student present during the burning of the Danish embassy in Syria said that the greatest difficulty he had regarding the  cartoons was making people understand that they weren't representative of the government's policy. Go figure.

For myself, I take this apology to heart and am deeply grateful that some Muslims are willing to attemt at peaceful coexistence.
&gt;Fair enough. I am a hard atheist - the facts combined with the scientific method lead me to the conclusion that god does not exist.

What do you know about [MAPS](http://www.equip.org/free/DB011.htm)?

Seems like Karma should contribute to an initial score.  And perhaps Karma should go below 1 as well.  A post (for example) by someone with a negative Karma would start out at some value below zero, which would relieve the burden on readers to mod down.
This should become one of Wikipedia's greatest hits.
The biggest problem is that these spam posts come in floods, and they push good articles off the "new" page quickly making it impossible for good articles to get enough votes to move from "new" to "hot". In that way they do a lot of collateral damage.
There were times when saying the counterexamples you name would have caused a serious stirr to. Give them some time, their sixties have yet to arrive :) But they will, eventually, I guess...
*"For example, it should lead to an efficient way of deciding whether a given large number is prime. No existing algorithms designed to do this are guaranteed to terminate in a finite number of steps."*

This sentence is obviously incorrect.  I hope the rest is not... ;-)
Combine that with the score threshold and it would be fairly easy to keep most people from seeing bad links.
While humorous yes, this is almost two years old.
This would just result in the spammer creating a new account, which reddit make as easy as possible as part of their business model.
There's really no practical way to block this, that I can see. To wit:
Blocking users with large negative karma won't help any; they'll just make new accounts, making the problem worse.
It may be possible to block a site; that is, each site has a 'karma', and eventually trying to post a link to this site is impossible, gets a negative initial score, or is only possible by users who have a large positive score. Even the site-based blocking can be circumvented in a number of ways (is foo.site.com the same site, and thus subject to the same penalties as bar.site.com? How about site.co.uk and site2.co.uk?)

Which leaves boosting articles posted by high-karma people and/or boosting articles pointing to high-karma sites. Both have a large potential for 'groupthink'. Not good.

Another option is a system I like, but I'm unsure of how to implement it: You don't just vote up or down, but you state a reason. This also solves problems where you are stuck ie when a good article is posted with a crappy descrip/title. Vote it up, or down?

Then again, that ruins the elegance of the reddit system.

I guess the current concept is just as good as any more convoluted system to try and avoid this from happening. I could live with the 'site karma' thing though, as long as it's properly implemented (hint: It takes a list of top-level domains like "co.uk", you can't just start counting periods, that's a security risk).

Seems to me that this is the unavoidable nature of a "democratic" site. Like a democratic government, it requires a certain degree of diligence and effort from its participants.

Personally, I don't mind. I'd rather spend a few seconds (or, at most, a few minutes) modding down stupid submissions than have a site decide for me what is and is not good.
True, but they get modded down so fast that, as long as you have your filter set, you don't have to see them for more than a few minutes.
There should be a 'report spam' feature on this site.

I'm a **devout** Christian and even I found that quote to be laughable.
&gt; You're forgetting Deists (a creator-god exists but is inherently unknowable).

I don't see why that category would need special treatment?

&gt; You also seem to be labelling someone a believer in an attempt to devalue their argument - worse, without any real evidence that they are a believer (as expressed in the parent post, mnemonicsloth's position is more consistent with deism or hard agnosticism).

Yes, my mistake, I somehow mixed up mnemonicsloth and lupin_sansei and made a big mess of it. Sorry about that.

&gt; Soft atheism, the "we ain't seen anything yet" position, is more consistent with the scientific method;

Well, here we disagree, I think the balance of our knowledge clearly sways towards the hard atheism side. I believe, but cannot prove, that the mostly non-rational way our brains work (another conjecture, but I am not making it lightly) keep many highly educated people from reaching that same conclusion.

&gt; there's a greater step involved in leaping from "evidence of absence" to "absolute proof of absence".

Certainly, but remember, it is the vagueness of the 'god' concept that precludes evidence of absence. And I think belief in god can be adequately explained from the point of view of evolutionary biology, low-level brain functions and historical and cultural developments. Belief in god persists not because the concept of god is so powerful, but because it fits nicely with the way our minds work. 

&gt; in defending hard atheism, [...] you are letting your personal prejudices trample the available evidence.

No, I assure you I am not. My position is a philosophically sound and well respected one - Wikipedia's atheism page has a compact overview of the different types of atheism.

&gt; even to the point of attacking the individual's right to believe what they please,

'Attacking' would be a pejorative. Debating, arguing, yes. I am trying to influence people, for sure.

&gt; I [...] absolutely refute that atheism implies a disbelief in the supernatural.

Oh, I don't think anyone is lumping those two together. Though I am anti-supernatural, for exactly the same reasons I am atheist - a belief in the supernatural is a belief in concepts that are posited to be beyond scientific understanding.
Video no worky.
I think that reddit needs to find a way to stop nasty little rashes like this.
1. Saad Hariri -- Saiad Hariri to the Guardian -- isn't just "a Lebanese politician".  He's head of a major parliamentary bloc, and the son of former PM Rafik Hariri, whose assassination by Syrian intelligence sparked a revolution that pushed (some of) the Syrian military and secret police out of Lebanon.  

2. Jamaa Islamiya appears to be the terrorist group that murdered 58 (or 62?) German tourists in Luxor, Egypt in 1997 and then renounced violence in 1998.  In which case, they don't seem to be doing all that well with the whole [satyagraha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha) thing.

Google tells me that Saiad Hariri is most likely a [misspelling](http://www.google.com/search?q=saiad+hariri) of Saad Hariri, the MP and coalition leader.

The analogous re-transliteration turns Jamaia Islamiya, the "conservative Sunni Muslim group" into Jamaa Islamiya, the former terrorist organization.  I'd love some more information about this, because what I can come up with in  a single attention-span is limited.  Anyone out there know anything about Eastern-Mediterranean Sunni political parties or how to correctly render Arabic in Roman characters?

&gt; Well, you are a believer.

And we all know that only the newest stuff makes it to reddit.
I agree that this one of the worst symptoms.  At least it seems solvable.  Flood control for multiple submissions to a single site?  

As reddit gets more popular the queue size will only get larger.  Although theoretically this is offset by more eyeballs on queue.

On the subject of the queue, one annoyance is not having a 'pager', id be interested to know the reason behind this design decision.  How about a pager, at least for the queue?

One reason that these problems are so hard to solve is because its so easy to create an account.  I think this is probably a fundumental reddit tenet ie. paul graham wrote about it.

So captchas might help the spam problem, others have yearned for tagging.  Sounding familiar?

A big part of what I like about reddit (over digg.com) is that its not just tech news.  (Although im sure the reddit powers-that-be might be a little concerned over the increasingly leftist leanings of the 'hot' page).  The other two features on reddit I prefer over digg is the 'negative-digg' and nested comments.  Ok, the community is a whole lot more mature as well.  

Hmm, I originally started that last paragraph expecting to conclude digg had a better system.

The different between disapproving of Bush vs Islamic Extremist:

If you say negative things about Bush, half the population agree with you.  The other half says it your freedom of opinion.  It is built into the system.  People are known to say, "I may not agree with it, but I will fight for your right to say it"

Disgree with any part of Islam (even the most extreme views), you are blasphemer and shall be put to death!  The middle east is in a state thought similar to the spanish inquisitions.  People don't challenge anything in the religon or any interpretation of their Moula's. 

If they revealed themselves, they would be in severe danger.
It could be that &lt;i&gt;The Island&lt;/i&gt; just sucked.  It only got a rating of ~40% on Rotten Tomatoes.  It's not a very convincing example.
Should be ok now. Please try again on the main server. Thanks.
While I agree with your point re: price of liberty is eternal vigilance, I think your kinda missing the point. 

At the moment it takes 5 redditors to bury a story to the default -4 threshold.  Lets say an abusive user like the ones mentioned in this post consistently get *all* their stories buried and *all* the stories point to the same site.  Lets say this has happened 60 times (as is almost the the case for nyc2)  At this point Id be quite happy for for the system to nuke this guys account/submissions.

Anyone else?  How about a vote?  ;o)

BTW digg has an 'ignore user' feature which i suppose is a bit more democratic.

The following is from www.arabnews.com of Saudi Arabia. 

"What separates us from the Christian and Judaic followers is not our sense of piety and reverence but our sentimental threshold. We are undeniably too sensitive and take offense easily. We are fiercely protective of our beliefs and value systems. But this is our prerogative. What shameful right does a Christian newspaper hold in patronizing us over a personal belief that neither defies basic human or moralistic values, nor infringe on cross-cultural sentiment?"

I think a flagging system like Craigslist has might be a good way to handle it.
My mistake, apologies again. I would edit my earlier reply but I reckon that would make an even bigger mess...
Its a good article isnt it it's got alot of good info I hope every one enjoy this like me

[deleted]
And how should I dress?
Amen. This article beggars belief... that and the number of folk who appear to agree with it. I mean, forget about the frequent burnings of rock albums, bombings of abortion clinics, about the time the US declared war on Mormons because they practiced bigamy, the whole IRA thing, the Nazi thing... everyone knows Christians and all non-Muslims NEVER do anything like that.

(edit)

To those who have downmodded this comment, please reflect on the articles' *demonstrably false* claim that non-Muslim religions do not indulge in violence. The author should not be fired for his opinions; he should be fired for his lack of integrity and knowledge of very recent history.
I agree with what you're saying on an intuitive level, but don't you feel a little nervous arguing, "I reject the following world view because it *might plausibly* arise from the following circuimstances" ?  There are other ways 

&gt; I don't see why [Deism] would need special treatment.

An anthropomorphic God who created the Universe, causes or allows it to function consistently according to physical laws, and for some reason wants adulation from the intelligent inhabitants thereof, would create a universe very much like ours.
buy the "No, I will not fix your computer" tee from ThinkGeek.
Yeah, classic.
How many humans have built pyramids, fought wars, composed symphonies, and pursued scientific investigation of the universe for the greater glory of Paisley Sofas?

If *you* think that belief in god is unaesthetic, or contrived, that's fine.  The 500 generations of human ancestors whose collective efforts have allowed us to give up hunting and gathering still oblige us to produce a less flippant answer.  The fact that you get to enjoy a lifestyle that 490 generations of humans WOULD have called heaven ("no maggots in the food!") is in no way a reward for how *smart* or *enlightened* you are.
I did great in algebra when I took it.  I would often finish the classwork and get started on my homework before some more confused souls could finish their classwork.  Often I would be asked to help those who I never talked to otherwise, much like Karin would not of been talked to by Johnny in the article.
This article is much better than the previous one that appeared on Digg.  The author appears to actually know what he's talking about this time.
I think what the author was trying to convey is that even though a full system restore wouldn't be needed, a usuer losing all of his pictures, documents, music files, etc. would be almost as devastating as having to restore the entire system.

Remember, the users he's talking about are the non-tech-savvy ones who just want to start their computer, do their thing and not have to think about anything else.

You may not like what he has to say, but he does have a point.

For typos or linkjacking, why not let the commenters suggest a new title or link, and when the suggestion is modded past the original title, it gets replaced?  That way everyone can mod the article based on the merits of the article, and mod the title or link or whatever separately.  You don't lose the reddit cleanliness, and you get to say "The title should be 'Buy stuff from my site'" rather than just "that title sucks"

For people like me who don't care about the title/link/comments on most articles, the whole thing is hidden.  People who care can participate as much as they care to.
Am I the one who finds this paragraph quite loathsome?:

"With the big tool companies declining to participate, SawStop is seeking other ways to make sure its technology is adopted. In April 2003, the company filed a petition with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to make SawStop-like technology standard on all table saws. Six months later, the Power Tool Institute, a consortium of 17 power-tool makers, filed an opposing brief in which it argued that SawStop is a "speculative and untested technology. In addition, the cost to consumers and manufacturers of granting the petition would far outweigh any benefits that may be realized." The industry also claims to be developing its own safety systems. The CPSC is expected to release its findings this summer. If it states, as Gass hopes and expects, that the technology is effective, it will be the first step in a long process of making SawStop -- or a similar injury-prevention system -- mandatory."

As cool as the technology is, it is totally WRONG to use gov't to force other manufacturers to adopt it (or something like it, which they could then probably sue over). If consumers want that safety, they'll buy it -Unless it comes at too much of a price premium, in which case they don't want to be forced to buy it. That's really lousy business, if you ask me.
haha - leave the Super Bowl trophy out of this ;) I wonder what Freud would have to say about trophies like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wohlfahrtsbriefmarke-fifa.jpg).
so let me see. your newspapers portray insulting stereotypes of a discriminated-against minority in your country so they get hopping mad and demand an apology. you're right: typical fascist behaviour, on the part of the danes. how brave of you to pick on the smallest kid in your classroom.
Much better than pay-for-pixel copy-cats.
Funny how they say Hollywood only does remakes, and then unwittingly use a remake as an example.  The Island *is* a remake, of "The Clonus Horror" (http://imdb.com/title/tt0078062/)

Of course, you've never heard of it unless you watch Mystery Science Theater 3000.




The best way to be a UNIX guru is reading the best Unix book: ["The UNIX Programming Environment"](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe/index.html) by Brian Kernighan, Rob Pike. One of the best computer science books ever written, like all  by Kernighan.

Kernighan and Pike also wrote the excellent paper: [Program Design in the UNIX Environment](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/doc/84/kp.ps.gz) (AKA "cat -v considered harmful")
Cool. I think this is a good thing.

As people have said before, LISP is not only for the crazy geniuses.
You also need, at bare minimum:

* Bow before me, for I am root
* Dammit Jim, I'm a sysadmin, not a babysitter
* There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't
* /dev/null
* Chicks Dig UNIX
* and of course..  Got Root?

Some lightsabers, various Tux and other penguin paraphernalia including Penguin Mints, etc. etc. doesn't hurt.  I have a Google magnetic pin with blinkenlights and a Compaq Tux Pez dispenser, but those are totally optional, don't beat yourself up too much if you don't have those.

Well, OK, beat yourself up anyway.  Make sure you upload the video and blog about it in gory detail.

Imagine to yourself a cartoon of Martin Luther King sodomizing little children. Are you seriously proposing an American newspaper would publish something so gratuitously offensive in the name of free speech? Of course not: because that's the line between freedom of expression and incitement to hatred. And a cartoon of mohammed with a bomb in headdress goes way over that line.
Boooring.  This is about how to *look* like a UNIX guru, man, not how to actually *be* one.  Get with the program.  Drink some Bawls and go to a con or something.

Eh, you seem to be very hung up on a technical legal term "felon," that doesn't directly relate to the performance of a president.

Say that I have an employee and he turns out to be a sex offender.  I'm pretty shocked, because sex offenders are awful, right?  But what if it happened when my employee was 18, his girlfriend 15, and his girlfriend's disapproving parents wouldn't let them get married, they had sex, and he therefore committed statutory rape.  Now he's out of jail, married to his girlfriend, has 2 kids that adore him, and he's proven himself trustworthy to me. But he's a sex offender, right, and I should be wary of employing him?  Clearly Bill was skeezy, and clearly my hypothetical employee was slightly skeezy, but it really has no relevance to the present, and I shouldn't get hung up on the legal definition.

Sometimes, a strict adherence to definitions only over-simplifies the situation.

Best commentary on the case I have read so far
[deleted]
This should have been headlined "Where Did Firefox Come From?"

yeah, i like the little king!
I agree with this suggestion.  When you mod something down you're supposed to be doing it to train a filter, not to mark something as spam. There's a difference between an article that bores you and one that you feel is an abuse of reddit, and the UI probably should reflect that.
The idea that originality is the problem is outrageous.  The Island got about half of the possible stars (or which ever rating system is used) in general.  Also the majority of the audience probably came from people who saw the original not 25 year old males.
ahhh the minority bullshit. Just a second I need to stone a raped woman and I will be back.
Replying the mnemonicsloth's rewritten comment, which brings up some new points:

&gt; There is no way to prove the existence of god. There is also no way to disprove the existence of god. If you don't believe me [...]

Oh, I do believe this, absolutely, in the modern sense of the word 'god', where all that is left of god is a concept that by definition can not be reasoned about. Of course, in any sense that 'god' did impinge on the world, he has been disproven, and thus the concept has devolved into a meaningles statement.

&gt; If you don't believe me, google up "Alvin Plantinga" -- he's a philosophy prof at Notre Dame -- and read a few of his papers.

He's a Christian apologetic, right (says Wikipedia)? I am going to need a better referral than that, really.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics#Intellectual_and_social_function_of_religious_apologetics  :
&gt; Apologetics serves an intellectual function within religious communities by providing arguments that support the doctrinal and ethical tenets of the religion. These arguments strengthen the believer's faith and support the propagation of the religion by offering arguments intended to persuade the uncommitted.

&gt; Skeptics engaged in debate with apologists tend to expect apologetics to consist of powerful arguments intended to persuade skeptics, and are sometimes surprised by the failure of these arguments to even approach this goal. Occasionally, it's because the apologist just isn't any good. Most often, though, it's because the arguments only had the purpose of giving current believers license to continue believing. Since skeptics are not the intended target at all, these arguments aim for a much lower burden, not trying to do more than make the religious belief plausible or cast doubt on skeptical arguments.

mnemonicsloth:
&gt; Shifting the burden of proof to the believer is thus a way to make believers lose the argument -- which isn't what this kind of discussion is supposed to be about.

That is just silly. Placing the burden of proof on the the party making the claim is simple common sense. One can make an infinite amount of claims about reality - any such claim is essentially worthless unless backed up by facts. Or you will need to consider [sofas circling Saturn](http://reddit.com/info?id=19z7#c1ae3). Of course, we have already agreed that the existence of god is placed outside of rational argument by the all too convenient definition of 'god', so the question is moot.

&gt; In particular, your proposition that 'it should be obvious that this is not a rational position to take' is not an argument. It's a statement of your opinion.

You are actually arguing that something is true unless disproven? (To quote myself: *The believer asserts that something is true unless disproven. It should be obvious that this is not a rational position to take.*) That is quite an amazing position to take. Have you thought this through? 

&gt; That makes you no better than all the other crazed believers.

I take objection to that. Perhaps you have just misread what I said, though. I hope so.
I agree in general with your comment.

&gt; I don't think it is naive to argue that if Bush did the crime, he's got to do the time.

That wasn't my point. I don't think it's naive to suggest deserved punishment. I think it's naive to say "if Bush did anything illegal". That's a conditional without meaning. Either it is impossible for him to do anything illegal, or he has already done illegal things, plans to do further illegal things, and has said so publicly.

&gt; If you have arbitrary enforcement, you don't have rule of law.

If that is the proper criterion, then I think you're saying we don't have rule of law.

&gt; Or perhaps break the law, and be prepared to be punished if you get caught.

Sure. Whatever. Don't you agree, however, that it is immoral to imprison someone for giving marijuana to a elderly person in order to ease pain?

In the unlikely event that I wind up on your jury for such a crime, prepare to walk away.
That . . . was . . . horrible.  Why didn't they have better rapping I mean agh really "its the legend of zelda and its really rad."  Come on, unless this was meant to be this bad, in which case its funny, that commercial would never make to the Superbowl.
I agree that the situation is ridiculous, and do not in any way condone theose who are protesting violently.  

But they are not acting for no reason at all.  Their reasons are poor, and I would say misguided, but they do have them, and we would do well to understand that these are not random irrational acts, but that there are reasons, even if they are poor ones.  I think Juan Cole's analysis here offers a good deal of light on understanding the phenomenon:
http://www.juancole.com/2006/02/muslim-protests-against-anti-muhammad.html

Note also that many in the U.S. still do not think that sacrelige is acceptable, there were actually fairly wide scale (and angry) protests here against 'Piss Christ,' 'Last Temptation of Christ,' etc.  Happily they were non-violent, but that was more due to the order of our society than the the protesters controlling themselves.  The same people who are currently trying to get flag burning illegalized, would be steadily trying to get anti-Cristian/sacreligious speech illegalied here if our Constitution was not in place to guarantee the right.
There are infinitely more egregious examples of christian terrorism than the Parents Music Resource Center.  How about the murder of abortion doctor David Gunn by Michael F. Griffin?  Or the murder of Barnett Slepian by James Kopp?  The list is much longer.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism
You don't have to be a genius, but it helps to be crazy.

I am still in school and I chose bottled water over the water fountains mostly because, well those are school water fountains, but at home I chose the tap water.  This aricle reminds of a hilarious comedian, Jim Gaffigan, from comedy central presents.
Well, the Big Bang is just a theory.  And it's not even all that satisfactory.  BUT, the actual quotes and the way in which this 24 year old "war room" veteran pushes an obvious agenda are genuinely disgusting.
I remember when I would play this at my uncle's house.  I used to think it was the shiz-nit. And then I found the nitndo 64 and games like Conker's bad fur day. Run little squirrel, run.
epicnicbasket.com has a toll free number. I imagine if 10,000 reddit users called....  Oh, never mind. :-)
Dress as shabbily as possible.  Never wear a shirt with a collar.  Make sure all your clothes look like they were just picked up off your bedroom floor and donned.  Throw away your razor and grow an unreconstructed, thick beard.  Let Richard Stallman be your fashion guide.  Act horrified if anyone in the office suggests wearing ties to an important meeting with outside clients (if the suits at your office are stupid enough to expose clients to you).  Suspenders are a great accessory.  Wear resolutely scuffed shoes.  

The ultimate test to discover if you are upholding Unix Guru fashion is to take a long look at yourself in the mirror before leaving for work and intone aloud, "Do I still look like a homeless person?"  If the answer is "yes", you've truly arrived.
Smug Lisp weenies, sensitive? Whatever gave you that idea?

When I read your original question (late at night), I interpreted it as making the assumption that newer languages would produce better results. Based on the followups, I can see that's not what you intended, but some people would rather click a down arrow than write a reply seeking clarification.
"Hindus may consider it odious to use cows as food, but they do not resort to boycotts, threats, and violence when non-Hindus eat hamburger or steak. They do not demand that everyone abide by the strictures of Hinduism and avoid words and deeds that Hindus might find upsetting."

I guess the author has no passing familiarity with occasional Hindu-Muslim clashes and rioting in India that has been going on for many years.  Many of the individual conflicts originated when a Hindu would release pigs in a Muslim neighborhood, or a Muslim would throw a dead a cow in a Hindu temple.  You can google 'hindu-muslim riot', to find articles on various riots.
What do you mean by a 'pager'?
Note the "Christian newspaper" label. I wonder if anyone working there would describe the paper as a "Christian newspaper." Understand this label, and you will begin to understand the real problem the West is having with the East.
Quick poll:

Reddit should have a separate 'spam' button
Rather than a separate 'spam' button, reddit should pull out low scoring articles (and users) as spam.

No, [incremental assembly-language programming](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/6d0abab38a07a15c?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off) has been available since at least the 60s.  Alas, the last ITS box was shut off in 1995.
Chicken is hardly what most people would call a "fast" Scheme.
Typical blog ... photos of kittens and complaints about other bloggers. Same old.

Although reddit won't allow negative karma, maybe the system could calculate a persons actual negative karma and then silently throw away submissions from really low karma people so it takes them a while to figure out they were banned.  Otherwise they would just make a new account.
From the numbers in this article, it seems to me that if you had a 33% tax on bottled water, it would solve all the world's water problems...

No one rapes children in the name of MLK -- granted. But there are groups of folk who blow up abortion clinics and burn books &amp; "demon music" in the name of Jesus. 150 years ago it was common to defend slavery by quoting the Bible; the Good Book has been used to justify all manner of atrocities... many of them recent. Don't be too sure of your moral superiority here. You should also look into the radical reactionary shift in Dutch politics in the last ten years. This is not a bolt from the blue.


I almost voted for the spam button, but I'm going to have to go for worse is better here. I think it should be harder to get negative karma than it is to lose karma, and I think that it should be hidden from public view for the reasons jedberg mentioned.

Some sort of rate limiting to discourage submitting a bunch of links from the same site all at once might be good too.

I gained a few pounds in college, but thanks to genetics or eating more sensibly, I quickly lost them again after graduation. 

In retrospect, a huge source of "stealth calories" for me was carbonated soft drinks. Choosing a glass of pop over a glass of (in my case foul-tasting Southern Californian) water could easily comprise the 112 excess daily calories. I often had five or six such glasses a day. 

If I had only put two and two together and realized that my near-inability to stay awake during 1-o'clock lectures probably had more to do with a mild insulin coma than dull material, I might have gotten better grades.

Deeply disturbing. I'm not sure why.
Choose no life. Choose sysadminning. Choose no career. Choose no family. Choose a fucking big computer, choose hard disks the size of washing machines, old cars, CD ROM writers and electrical coffee makers. Choose no sleep, high caffeine and mental insurance. Choose fixed interest car loans. Choose a rented shoebox. Choose no friends. Choose black jeans and matching combat boots. Choose a swivel chair for your office in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose NNTP and wondering why the fuck you're logged on on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting in that chair looking at mind-numbing, spirit-crushing web sites, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last on some miserable newsgroup, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up lusers Gates spawned to replace the computer-literate. 

Choose your future.

Choose sysadminning.

some of them use a waist pouch too, with some gadgets inside and a usually a caculator.
Not all articles modded down are spam.  Sometimes they are innocent reposts.  Sometimes they are articles that perhaps only two people disagreed with, modded down, and thus go into negative-land.

Reddit points can mean a variety of things; negative points do not necessarily mean a bad article, and lots of positive points do not necessarily mean a good article.  (On a side note, it might be fun to, in addition to a "Top" page, have a "Bottom" page, with the all-time lowest articles.  What might we find?  We might not want to know...)
I see what you did there.  =)
It stinks!
Spam is certainly different to Reddit and to the people who post it, but I'm not sure it's so different to the reader. There's a lot of stuff I don't want to see on Reddit: celebrity gossip, linkjacking, astroturfing, porn, press releases, spam. All that really matters to me is that I don't want to see it, and a down arrow provides me with that option.
A widget that allows you to select a specific page, like on google:

G o o o o o o o o o  g l e

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 next

or like:

1 2 3 4 5 .... 47 48 49

(edit) the second option would give a "worst stories" feature as well like another poster mentioned..
Some things to think about:

* while this article debates the usefulness of bottled water, its highly controversial whether tap water is really that good for you too. A plain fact of life is that most water is flushed, goes down the drain in the shower, is used in washing machines &amp; dish washers, and whatever else - and its simply too expensive to get the water whistle clean - like 7ppm solid particulates.

* municipalities should be constantly monitoring their water for contaminants, but (1) many "upper safe limits" set by the FDA/EPA (EPA in this case) are controversial, and there isn't total agreement on what should be monitored in the first place. Some may monitor MTBE and perchlorate, while others do not. Note that there are literally thousands of chemicals in water - some natural , some man-made, and testing for all of them is tough. Water from the colorado river seems to have high levels of perchlorate.

* Municipal water quality *may* change by season. In Phoenix, when the monsoons come, supposedly the solid particulates are elevated.

* your best bet for clean safe water is to either find a filter for your home which is reverse osmosis and steam distilled - but beware, because there are lots of peddlers in this domain -- or find a water store *that you can trust* - see below. If using a home-water filter, use a potassium rather than sodium ion exchanger.

* if you decide to go the water-store route, realize that they don't all use the same equipment, some may be more deligent than others about when to replace their filter, and some may be able to give you independent report which shows their filter effectiveness. See below on water storage. The person working at the store, or the owner, should at least be able to tell you what the typical amount of solid particlates in ppm is - it should be between 5 and 15.

* locate a lab in your area that can analyze the water for particulate matter and other disolved compounds. if your tap water / water store / home filtered water lives up to your expectations, great.

* For storing water: glass works best, but there are some obvious disadvantages. It is the most stable, and there will be no chance of solvents "leaching" into your water. For portability, re-use a bottle, like a Nalgene bottle to minimize environmental waste. Whatever brand you decide on, your best bet looks like polycarbonate despite the fears of bisphenol. Polycarb is a hard clear plastic - get something without dyes. Avoid the plastic bottles that look "cloudy", often used for 1 and 1.5 gallon bottled water. Avoid plastic bottled made out of PET (pet polyethylene tetraphthalate). If you use a plastic bottle, don't expose it to much UV (sunlight), as it is unknown whether the bottle you hold in your hand has UV stabilizers. To be extra safe, avoid exposing your polycarb bottles to exreme heat - like the dishwasher - even though a study showed that this is generally not a problem. Other plastics may fare more poorly. Some popular glass bottle sizes might be able to fit into a insulation sleve often fitted for Nalgene bottles - you can get these at an REI or other outdoor sports store.

* Distilled water is OK for you, but make sure you get total, in your diet, the right amount of Magnesium and Calcium. Studies have shown that there is a corelation between cardiovascular disease and localities which have water low in minerals - but you can make up for this yourself by taking a good Calcium (calcium citrate) or Magnesium (magnesium citrate) supplement, which are often cheap. Try Solgar, Now, Solaray, or Nature's Way. Recommended ratio Ca:mg used to be 2:1 , but now is like 1:0.7.

* folks with kidney problems may have to pay even more attention to water quality,

How about lynching the first black man you see after a white woman is raped? Muslims do not have a monopoly on depraved mob violence.
There are definately different reasons for not liking an article.

An example to illustrate this, although not as important as abuse would be duplicates.

I resist marking down duplicates (especially if the topic is of interest to me) because I dont want to 'train out' that particular submitter/whatever - he/she may have submitted at nearly the same time or just not seen the previous story etc.  But I do want to bury the story nonetheless (for various reasons ie. not fragmenting the vote, rewarding the original submitter).

Mark as spam, duplicate.  Brings us back to the digg model of having a listbox.

As I mentioned in another post in this thread, digg have an "ignore user" that hides all stories/comments for that user.  This would be much more helpful to me that the current "hide story" button.

*Unemployed liberal atheist Lisp programmers.*

Am I missing anything? 

:)

The title to this is a misnomer
I don't agree with your examples, because Muslims have a right to be offended about religious things.

But I do agree with the "no reason whatsoever", because of the following:

http://www.zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/

Images of Mohammed have been published in children's books for decades, and were even drawn by ancient Muslims. Picking the Danish newspaper out of all these examples and rioting about that is totally random.

Read the article yesterday in print. Reactions:

1. A "South Park" episode isn't much to build on.

2. Is it possible that the uproar--which struck me as utterly fake--involved Janet Jackson because she has given occasional indications of being a real person, where Justin Timberlake seems to have been die stamped in a boy-band factory?

3. On the other hand, yes, you need to tell your sons to be responsible.

4. Good for her confiscating the hat.

5. Teaching "human sexuality education"? She's sending those 7th graders out to teach "human sexuality"? Wow.

If it was a choice of these two it would be for a spam button due to the 'marking is for training' issue mentioned elsewhere.

" Security vendor Kaspersky Lab Ltd. said it appears that two or three Russian hacker squads sold an exploit for the Windows Metafile (WMF) vulnerability that raised alarms in December."
LOL
Forgive me, but the notions of "might makes right" and "us versus them" are more dangerous than any cartoon.
and you represent what kind of innocent minority?

There's still no better judge of content than a human. So there's no better solution than that. However, adjusting posting priviliges by people who's articles have taken a nosedive in the past sounds like a good idea.
The original statement was "(in the UK).. Most people ... get on just fine without believing in God." 

That's incorrect. In the UK at least equal numbers believe in God as those who don't.
These folks don't need to be apologizing to Danes, but rather, need to be taking their respective cultures and communities back from the nut cases who they've put in charge. Iran and Palestine are two prime examples of entities that are at the cusp of their greatest opportunities in the last 400 years to be leading, independent, successful demonstrations of the potential that their respective societies have to offer. In both cases they have opted, through relatively democratic processes not available throughout the rest of the Islamic world, to reject peace, reason, and co-existence with the rest of humanity and are in the process of reversing all the progress and efforts made heretofore. Spitefully tossing to the wind all the sacrifices made by their own people and those who put their trust and hope that they could successfully self-govern. The rest of the world is dismayed and shocked at these events but will not also let these decisions take the rest of us with them. We hate to see you screw yourselves up but you sure as heck better contain your troubles within your own borders. After you've proved wrong everone who believed in you, who will have the heart and will to support you ever again? Time's short to fix this. Until a clear majority speaks and acts against this insanity within these cultures they have lost all credibility for those who truly want peace. Guess who that leaves to deal with them?
None; that's the point. I am the product of a half-dozen peoples who raped &amp; pillaged each other for thousands of years. Isn't it time we stopped?

Demonizing people based on stereotypes is one of the reasons we're in this mess. Not only is it hypocritical, it encourages you to think of "them" as less civilized (ie, less human) than "us". From there it's a short step to justifying violence against them.
No the burden of proof is on the OP for making the bold statement that God doesn't exist. Looking at the replies not one of them even attempts to prove God doesn't exist, they just shift the burden to the believer.
Not necessarily.  Just start Karma on 0 instead of 1.  Can't mod up your own posts.  Put all 0 posts in an area for mavens, let users set their own browsing threshold.  Detect spam account detection (one account always modding up another account's posts within N hours, for example).

Should be pretty easy to fix this.  They need a good rec filter anyway.  Slashdot, for all of its problems, has a reasonable solution to this (modding/filtering) -- I rarely see the spam there.
I would think things would change for the better.  Thomas Friedman describe it as the curse of oil, he wrote in his book, The World is Flat (I highly recommend it):

"
When a nation's leaders can practice petrolism, they never have to tap their people's energy and creativity; they simply have to tap an oil well. And therefore politics in a petrolist state is not about building a society or an educational system that maximizes its people's ability to innovate, export and compete. It is simply about who controls the oil tap.

In petrolist states like Russia, Iran, Venezuela and Sudan, people get rich by being in government and sucking the treasury dry -- so they never want to cede power. In non-petrolist states, like Taiwan, Singapore and Korea, people get rich by staying outside government and building real businesses.
"

It isn't the entire story, because a lot of other factors play a large roles in the wealth of nation.

Now you're shifting the burden of proof onto me. The burden of proof is on the one who made the assertion. Since mikaelhg said God doesn't exist he has to prove why he doesn't exist.

"... when anyone is making a bold claim, it is not someone else's responsibility to disprove the claim, but is rather the person's responsibility who is making the bold claim to prove it."

Ok to please you I will limit to the God of the Old Testament. Now prove to me that he doesn't exist.
Lets call radical islam what it is: Facism. Its ugly. 

Don't be surprised if we have to fight fascism again. It wasn't nice the last time around - left my great grandfather blind, and grandfather with lifetime malarial complications. But it was worth it they told me.
You complain about Muslims, yet respond like this? I'm appalled by the recent actions of so-called "protesters" (i.e. mindless thugs) in places like Afghanistan and Palestine. But surely one of their greatest faults is the readiness with which they make sweeping generalisations about entire nations of people as if they were single entities? 

How are your stereotypes any different? Your suggestion that people can only be made to "learn" through killing and maiming sounds remarkably familiar.  Does descending to their level not just defeat the whole point of defending the freedom to print the cartoons in the first place? 

Seriously, you should read more about [the context ](http://english.ohmynews.com/ArticleView/article_view.asp?menu=A11100&amp;no=272655&amp;rel_no=1&amp;back_url=) before deciding who "deserves" to learn their lesson. After all how many Scandinavians do you actually know?

cut the crap. Which mess? That some cartoons fire up some hooligans to start destroying things and have a "reason" to do so. A person based on any type of faith or belief that lynchs a raped woman is less civilized than someone that helps the same woman. If you want to live on the guilty of your antecessors go ahead and set yourself on fire as a gift to the gods.
I can confirm this. I live in Flagstaff, AZ and whenever I go down to Phoenix I drink bottled water.

However, I have had water at restaurants while I'm there and usually it tastes just fine. Perhaps most restaurants use purified water?
The "mess" being the very real danger of another war between Western countries and the Middle East, of which this "little incident" is just a part, and the abysmal lack of understanding displayed by the Op-Ed and the comments on this page. Instead of arguing points, you resort to slang and insults. If two random people who speak the same language cannot really communicate about this issue, I'd say that's a serious mess.
No kidding. The $10/gallon figure almost nobody pays, unless you count containers a liter or smaller from a convenience store.

To do a fair comparision between that and gas, I think you would have to compare it to a small container of propane for barbecuing, when purchased from a convenience store.

Actually, the Palestinians posted cartoons making fun of 9/11. In fact, they cheered in the streets, and we still send them money. Pay attention.

Used this several times before, its great. I just wish that it  could make overlapping groups of nodes..
I fully agree.  

I dont think this is a big problem.  The new threshold system has made a massive difference.  Many average joe users wont even see this problem because they only use the 'hot' and maybe the 'recommended' page.  This is really only an issue for redditors who tend the queue.  And its only a minor annoyance.

The point of the submission (and its one that i agree with) is that for _obvious_ abuse it *might* possible to do something about it.  (obvious as in: 1 user + 60 submissions to one site + all modded down)

I think adding a spam button is probably overkill, its just more interface clutter.  On that point, get rid of the hide button too ;o)
That was rad.
The only efficient algorithms for primality known in 2000 were randomized, ie., not guaranteed to terminate in a finite number of steps. It has since been proven that deterministic polynomial algorithms for primality do in fact exist.

Considering that this is a popular science article I think bending the truth a tiny bit is completely defendable. It allows her to avoid explaining what the words randomized, deterministic and polynomial mean and how, in fact, there *is* an algorithm guaranteed to terminate in a finite number of steps, just not an *efficient* one.

I was just saying that anyone who wanted to spam wouldnt use an account that had 'negative karma' when they can easily create an account that has the same karma as any other new user.

Interesting you mention slashdot.  Slashdot encourages you to browse at minus one (the lowest level) when you have 'mod points'.  The equivalent of this is tending the reddit queue with filtering disabled.

I quite clearly understand that most of the Middle East is now rioting because somebody in Denmark used a freedom that we consider to be the most sacred right we have as people, in his own country, and they don't like it.

Well, tough. He didn't do anything to any of their countries, and their laws don't apply in his.

If there has to be war, then I don't know of any ideals that I would rather fight for than freedom of speech.
Are you joking, or are you actually rejoicing in depravity and violence? You seem to realize the horrific consequences of making the world afraid of you... yet you don't care. Friend, *that* is the true reason many people are gunning for the US. The real "crazy fuckers" are not in the streets of Beruit.
They are not "more likely" to react violently.

They HAVE reacted violently.

When I read their cartoons mocking and insulting my people, it makes my blood boil, but I support their right to create and publish them, and I'm certainly not going to go set the nearest mosque on fire.
Who cares what the cause is. Its not acceptable today.
You hit the nail on the head, friend. Imagine two groups of people who DON'T want to fight anymore. How would you get them to fight? Why, find an incident that transgresses on their respective sacred beliefs, preferably ones which are not clearly understood by the other. Westerners, being secular folk, do not "get" why a cartoon of the Prophet is so bad. Those Arabs who live in openly repressive places do not understand the grail of free speech.

There are people of all faiths and all countries who do not want more war. This baiting and jingoism drowns out their efforts, as it is intended to do. It is not coincidence that this occurred now (the imminent opening of the Iranian Euro market for oil, the referral of Iran to the UN, the scandals in the Iraqi Oil Ministry) and is being played up by those on both "sides" who want more war. It's a simple power play: consolidate your power by making your people angry and afraid. Shout loudly to cover the noises of war preparation. 

The cartoons are a convenient excuse. The tactic works en masse -- the counter to it, critical thinking and self-education, only comes one person at a time.
Exactly, what seems to be the case is that a little bit of information triggered a huge reaction in a lot of islamic societies.

The same type of information did not trigger as huge a response in the "western" countries.

Their society is very allergic to certain kinds of information. When your society can't process information correctly, then that's a bug in the system in my opinion.

But don't forget the other side of it. The west has had it's hand in creating the bug by doing things most average citizens haven't read about in the papers.

Yes, the radicals are wrong in hurting other people physically in response to just information, but keep in mind that there's a reason they're this fucked up. They live in totalitarian regimes and they've been attacked from a lot of sides. Their religion has something to do with it but I also think other factors have made them into radicals.
I have a very nice and well maintained bridge I would like to sell you :-)

Come on - I know there is some radiation - but 3W? And enough to boil an egg? That would not be a suspect of long term cancer or give you a slight warm feeling on your ear after 30 minutes talking - that would literally fry your brain!
Glancing at the headline I thought it said my brain would deteriorate after age 18 -- *sob* -- but the article actually implies brain maturity comes after 18 -- *yay* ... [yes I'm significantly older than 18...]
But that doesn't make any sense.

They can make caricatures of Jesus, Moses, Buddah, Jews, etc.

They can laugh and celebrate as thousands of civilians in our countries die.

Hell, they can even make their own drawings of Mohammed like at: http://www.zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/

But yet when we do, they yell "Off with their heads!" and set things on fire.

I say that there is as something wrong with their culture now as there was something wrong with the German culture in 1940. And it may very well have the same result.

That doesn't mean that they are inherantly evil, or that Islam is inherantly evil and violent, no more than Germans are. 

Fanaticism has taken over them, and we have to fight it, before it kills us.
So this is what it's like to be Danish... doesn't feel all that different.

I believe you can compile Python into C as well.  Ruby currently doesn't have much in terms of speed, but I believe that's meant to change in 2.0.  So, I think the speed is an advantage the Lisp family will not hold for long.  Of course, I think it will be quite some time before anyone catches up to Lisp's metaprogramming abilities.  I don't yet see how you can have Lisp's metaprogramming without the odd syntax (or lack of syntax), and then the language would join the Lisp family.
It reads to me as just a matter-of-fact description of America. As if he's describing the weird reality of America + saying it's regrettable but saying it from a bird's eye view.
The complaint about the age of an article is going to become reddits equivalent of slashdots "first post"
Why do they call it "the clash of civilizations"? I can see only one civilization here, where by "civilization" I mean a civilised, educated, open,  empirical, non-theocratic, judicial and progressive society?
Exactly. If your nod has to transfer all files being transferred by a significant portion of you your neighbours for this to work, it's either going to lead to slowness on the scale of those anonimizer networks (which this essentially just is), lead to concession of its effect or, more likely, be dismissed as a theorhetic tidbit.

Also, the RIAA local net tap seems utterly unfeasible.
It is; a "featured article".
*On Saturday, I appeared on CNN, which was so terrified of reprisal that it "pixelated" the very cartoons that its viewers needed to see.*

Pathetic.
Actually, that should be generalized - there are many reasons for voting up or down, but trying to cover them all ruins the elegance of reddit. But, as you are also training that filter, it's of some importance to be able to separate filter training from recommending. The simplest way of doing this would be to have 2 up and 2 down arrows, and obviously it would have to be an optional feature that you enable in your profile.

Some reasons for a mismatch between the 'recommend' and the 'prefer' arrows:

A bunch of reasons why you may have a mismatch between 'recommend' and 'prefer':
- guy kawasaki items. I follow his blog, so I don't want them on my reddit. However, I certainly would recommend his stuff to other reddit readers.
- dupes. I want to anti-recommend them but I don't want to train my filter against them (I want to leave that neutral).
- spammed all over the earth type things: You know everyone and the kitchen sink already knows about this so you don't think it needs to go up on reddit, -BUT-, the content of the article is of such value that you certainly don't want to train against it.
- horrible reddit post: The title is in all caps, just bad, wrong, blogspamming, etc, so you want to recommend against it, but you don't want to train your filter against it.
- interest mismatch: It doesn't interest you, so you want to train against it, but you think it's particularly well written and hence would recommend it to other readers.
Exactly.  

Japan is not a part of Europe, but they happily joined up with Hitler and Mussolini to form the Axis Powers.
You don't geddit. aristus' theory is that there are forces that want war, as if there's some kind of benefit or profit in it. Ofcourse there isn't if you add everything up, but there is profit for a small group.

It SEEMS that we can rile their side up with some pictures. And you basically say: that could never happen with us, being led into a fight with pictures. So what WOULD set the west off on a fight?

Maybe something like: "Fanaticism has taken over them, and we have to fight it, before it kills us."

So what you are basically saying is: We could never be nudged into violence/war like them with pictures, they're crazy so we must fight them (war) before they they kill us.

Logic has left your brain, really!

I agree that the reaction of the extremists is incredibly bad, but what I haven't read in the newspapers is what percentage of the people have rioted and what percentage has stayed home and shrugged their shoulders. I don't think war is an "efficient" way to lessen their threat. It'll make things worse. Maybe it's just a small group that's conciously radical, there must also be a lot of "I feel good in this radical group-thing" sheep but most thinking muslims are probably sitting at home watching the weirdness unfold, like we are.
Yes try a filter. Our mediocre water tasted great after getting a filter, and it works out heaps cheaper than buying bottled water.
Interesting story, but it fails to address some of the larger issues that are probably driving this behavior.

Why do studios feel the need to have such outrageously large ticket sales virtually assured before they will even consider greenlighting a movie? Perhaps the reason is because the system itself has become so top-heavy and obese that it needs audiences in the tens of millions for every movie in order to sustain itself. Movie stars, directors, and special-effects houses that demand millions or tens of millions of dollars per production, a push towards overly polished and refined end products, and the countless mid-level parasites that take their cut at every stage of the process have combined to turn Hollywood into something far exceeding the parodies that it has always inspired. The actual work that all of this machinery is supposed to support (making movies) has become just one minor cog in an immensely complex Rube Goldberg contraption.

Little wonder, then, that the industry has found itself more and more addicted to sure hits like remakes and sequels. And it's likely to get a lot worse before it gets better (if it ever does).
A jihad on all who click on the above link. Osama sees all your IPs.
Yeah. Thre's always a tradeoff between security and privacy, it's mostl just logical.


Still, one of my questions is how sure they were about the 5000 beforehand - whether this was in part just a question of laziness with an excuse.

You generally don't tap phones to find bad guys, you tap phones to verify suspected bad guys are just that. Find one out of dozens? Score! Out of of hundreds, I suppose. But if they are, hypothetically, wrong about 4999 out of 5000 you have to wonder about their methods of finding anyone efficiently (or figure this was in part a fishing expedition, but I sort of doubt that). 


I sort of understand an information theory-like approach to things like this. Bigger nets mean more probability, and some less tactfully puttable things.

The about that thing is that if implicit or explicit spying rights are granted merely because it's simpler than doing intelligent intelligence, you have something to discuss...
Now, now - you're taking this too far. We all know it feels great to imagine that democracy - nay, *civilization itself* is under siege from a billion Muslims eagerly foaming at the mouth to murder us all, while we Redditors, the *sole defenders of liberty*, valiantly rate up articles in the heroic struggle against Islamofascism.

BUT, it is a universal truth that in almost any situation, the majority of people simply wish to be left alone to raise their families. You'll rarely hear from them precisely *because* of that - they don't want to risk getting involved.
That is an interesting page. The drawings of the Prophet done by Muslims you cite are hundreds of years old. I can think of a few early-Christian rites that would not be advisable to try out on your local minister -- such as the kiss of brotherhood. No culture is monolithic or static. This is very important to keep in mind.

It's easy to imagine that the Muslim-in-the-street is being manipulated into anger... for instance, by the three very inflammatory images faked up by the Dutch imams. But are you *sure* you are not being manipulated too? Already you are equating Muslim countries with National Socialist Germany.

It's an important point, though. No amount of ranting, railing, and truth will do any good in a democracy unless it gets publicized and understood. And that's where Bush always wins.

About 10 seconds after you do this, all the spammers will rewrite their spam scripts to create a fresh new account before posting spam. Then they'll maintain a dozen or hundred random accounts to vote up their spam -- however many it takes to get things on the home page. The only way you're going to prevent spam is by filtering based on content, with a nice bayesian filter.

As I read about how colleges teach programming, I realize more and more why Berkeley/MIT/CMU/etc. do things the way they do.  

At Berkeley, the first CS class is taught in Scheme, and one of the assignments is write a Scheme interpreter in Scheme, that can run all of the exisiting Scheme programs, as well as support infix operators.

At the time, we all thought it was quite silly to write an interpreter for a language in that language, but now it is all starting to become clear...

I was one of the people who hadn't heard of *The Island* until the release day... after our last final of first-year engineering, a bunch of us went to the theatre and saw it.

And you know what? I [really enjoyed it](http://uwmike.com/articles/2005/08/13/the-island). It's campy and over-the-top, and maybe I was just on a post-exam high, but it was a really *fun* movie.

The marketing campaign failed with me. I had no idea what to expect. On the other hand, I also didn't carry the baggage of a "40% RT Score" with me into the cinema. I was open-minded, not thinking I needed to hate it to consider myself a connoisseur. An RT score may point to Oscar material, but it's not the be-all and end-all of movie suckage.

Indeed. Muslims with a keen eye for history, and an open mind must be horrified.

Spammers will sabotage it by marking legitimate articles as spam.  Perhaps if you weight it based on the percentage of the submitter's own articles marked as spam.
I'm not equating them with the Nazis.
For one, they're not that well organized.
And they're certainly not nearly that bad yet.

It's just an example of a country with a problem.
They obviously have a problem. Violent outbursts, for one thing. And it needs to be solved, before it starts really creating casualties. 

I'm sure that most of the people there want the violence to stop as much as we do. Again, just as in Nazi Germany, the majority weren't really Nazi's.

Hopefully, this can be done without war.

But seriously, you know that ferry that sank in Egypt? A crowd of "protestors" set fire to that company's headquarters today.

People see violence being performed, and that the perpetrators aren't punished, so they take out their grief on setting other things on fire.
Saying it's bad because it's rushed, while true in some cases, is a pretty simplistic explanation.

First, there's a lot of reporting that comes out that isn't "late-breaking news". Many of those contain false statements or other bad reporting -- for example, the wine story's false conclusion.

Second, there are many instances where reporters intentionally lie or practive self-deception.

I don't think that being rushed is a good excuse for bad reporting.
Here are the things that I think would rile the West off on a fight:

1. Having our embassies torched.
2. Having our citizens abroad kidnapped, tortured, and beheaded.
3. Demands by people from another country that we curb the freedom of speech in our country.

However, even that really isn't enough. And we're certainly not going to go to war over this.

But certainly I think that we need to cut off all our aid. I mean what sense is it to send money to people who proclaim loudly every day that they want to kill us?

But I think that there is only so much hate that they can throw our way before we finally get pissed off.
So it was a lunatic's pamphlet, not an actual published newspaper that was generally on sale.
And how do they reconcile [this][] with their own licensing terms?

The Scientists in the US know there is no competition between countries in science but with the US fucked-up attitude about doing something for the common good (labelling it immediately as communism and seeing this as a reason not to do it for itself) they don't have much choice but to argue that funding Science will help the US to stay on top.
Wow. That's got to be the most blatant press hit I've read in a long time.
[deleted]
You said: "But I think that there is only so much hate that they can throw our way before we finally get pissed off."

It could be the reverse actually. There have been bombings by the west on islamic countries. Maybe what we're seeing is a combination of them finally getting pissed off at "US" + extremists whipping them up into war fever.

Who are those extremists exactly? Who are the core group of radicals? And how big is this group as a percentage of the population?

Would be a shame if a small group was "responsible" for the US to "finally get pissed off (war)" while the majority did nothing. I just don't know, certain things aren't said.

I do know one thing though. The extremists, whatever their group size is, are wrong.
[deleted]
Well, if that's your only criteria... the US went through harrowing civil violence all throughout the 20th century, from the Wobblies to the KKK to race riots in LA. Not to mention being involved with invasions or coups in nearly every country in their hemisphere -- some of them two or three times. (The only exceptions, I believe, are Bolivia &amp; Canada)

I am not condoning the violence. I am anti-war and most especially anti-propoganda. That I why I am taking pains to point out how easily similar things could be spun by someone with an agenda. If I were to look at the US circa 1965, I'd think the whole place had gone insane: riots in the streets, reactionaries with nuclear weapons, etc etc etc.

The thing that is wrong with Muslim states is how the people are being stirred up by their religious and political leaders and the media. Just like everywhere.

This article comes at a particularly good time for me, since I'm in my second year of grad school and am starting to think this might not be the right thing for me. I went straight from college to grad school, against others' advice, because at the time that I applied I felt I was ready. By the time I started to realize I might have been wrong about that, I'd already been accepted at UCLA and thought it would be foolish to decline. So I didn't take any time off, and am now burned out and unmotivated. I'm also afraid to quit, since I don't actually know why I don't like  grad school, or what I'd rather be doing instead.

Here's a funny thing: in accordance with what Paul said, I do actually produce on a regular basis. I write/blog, I work on my webpage, I cook, I bake, I draw, and I foster meaningful relationships with other people. The problem is that I don't see what I produce leading to any sort of career. I don't blog about anything that would fascinate a general audience. I don't want to make webpages for anyone but myself. I have tendinitis in my wrists, so I can't pursue cooking (or, probably, drawing) as a profession. And I'm so incorrigibly sincere that I can't make a living out of any of the (well-paying) jobs that require fostering relationships with lots of people. So while I know what I love, in that sense, I don't know how to translate "what I love" into a job that I love.

Still, I'm quite young, so I have plenty of time to figure things out, but of course in the meantime I'm left wondering what to do. Should I stay with the safe path I'm already on, or blaze a new trail for myself? Sigh. I wish the people who had told me grad school was "really hard" would also have mentioned that there was so much uncertainty involved.

http://www.lisabug.net
I really would like to know what the percentage is.
But I doubt its that small, Hamas did get elected in Palestine, for example.

But hey, if that minority siezes power, well then, we're screwed anyway, even if they are the minority.
I'm sure you're right about what they would do, but I see two good ways to deal with it without a spam button:

* Add captchas to the account creation process (not my preferred solution, but easy)
* Write algorithms to detect that sort of behavior - I suspect there's already something pretty close in use by the recommendation engine. Low-karma accounts that routinely promote articles that are routinely demoted by high-karma accounts are detected as spammers. (elegant from the user's perspective, but harder to write - my preferred solution)
The usual distribution is 10% good folk, 10% right bastards, and 80% who could go either way.

Believe me, I would love nothing more than peace.
I wish everyone would sit down, shut up, and go take care of themselves and their family.

The problem with being peacable comes when the other guy isn't. 

Hell yeah, the US is not the model of perfection. I'm not saying that. It shouldn't have meddled in other countries, and the people there have every right to fight back.

However, the currect crisis is about the Muslim states telling us what WE can't do IN OUR OWN COUNTRIES. And they're doing it with violence against innocent people.

I'm very much against that.
Whichever works better.
Limit the number of submissions per minute for an user. That solves the problem (mostly). Also check the http-referrer.

I am not sure it is banning them so much as requiring the user to clear them with the models involved. The reason for this would likely have to do with the model's future career. If I used the images in such a way that the model lost future work, well it is only fair to check with the model, no?
I don't like that there are touchy subjects out there, but I personally would not like to have my photos used in a piece of anti abortion literature, others might fear for future jobs if their image appeared in a religious context...

Yeah, the argument that The Island failed because it was too *original* (!) was pretty astounding. Sounds like he didn't see Logan's Run either.
My freshman year of college I lived with a staunch objectivist.  He was an active member of the Objectivist club (I think he was the President).  He was a little odd.  An example:

One day I said that our room was warm, and wanted to keep the window open overnight.  He said he wanted it closed.  I suggested a compromise, at which point he retorted, "Compromised is for the weak, and is not in my self interest."  I then proceded to jam the window open so it could never be closed again, at which point he said that he respected me for acting in my own self interest.  At least he was consistant...
There is a large population of Muslims in Holland, concentrated mostly in Rotterdam and Amsterdam. There has been LOTS of violence back and forth in the last ten years. After the murder of Theo Van Gogh several Muslim schools where torched in Rotterdam. This is not a case of peace-loving chocolate-eating Danes publishing a funny drawing; the story is just as involved and bloody as race relations anywhere, anywhen.

"*There's no discernible reason for the muslims to act this way, except that they are easily excited and violent.*"

This is exactly the vicious message the original Op-ed is trying to put across... that Muslims are just inexplicably violent for no reason.

The cartoons came alongside news that the Danish army was deploying troops to the Middle East. Whoops.

There have been several recent race riots in the States; usually after a policeman beats or kills somebody. The last was in Cincinatti, Ohio, a few years ago.

(NB: Denmark &amp; Holland are different countries, yes, I am a dirty American; I've only been to Holland so I used them as an example. Denmark has about 200K Muslims itself)

I had the same thing. On the later versions of Adblock you can just right click the "Adblock" link in the status bar to disable it.
Gmail chat appears to be a web interface to Google Talk, which by the way, it's worth noting, is just Jabber. People on Google Talk can communicate with any other Jabber user at any Jabber server anywhere. This is a very good thing.
You can protect against that by only counting spam votes
from people with a certain amount of karma.
This is the kind of incident which might lead to another world war...  I am sorry, but the Muslim religion has shown itself time and time again to be one of the most sensitive, intolerant and oppressive religions known to man.  If they are so much better than the Infidel, they will simply brush off these cartoons as Unworthy of Notice, just like the Infidels who generated them.  But it seems they just can't pass up on an opportunity to have a little riot here and there.  Have you ever noticed the amount of small children present at these riots?  Do you think they actually know what is going on?  Come on, many of them are pre-teen kids!  They are just being schooled from an early age in the art of the angry protest which will become their way of life...

Have both spam and duplicate buttons (and how about an edit button that will allow trusted users to fix typos in link titles?), but don't put all these links at the top level.
Instead either put them on the comment page, or have an "admin" link that only appears when a user reaches a certain level of karma.

Part of it is "bad news == good news" on the part of the media. Its kind of self fulfilling. 

Indonesia, who has the largest population of muslims in any one nation, has been perfectly peaceful (which is amazing, they are always at war with some remote province most days). Protests have been entirely protests. Not demonstrations. They don't want war.

Badly formatted and mostly well-known information about Apple's PowerPC woes.

The first thing this makes me think of is "ignorance of the law is not a defense". Except this situation is different...it's not ignorance of the law, but not being aware that the law is being broken...and it seems like it's only conscious, willful breaches of the law that matter in this case.

This comment box is too narrow, it's a problem.
What would be cool would be one that somehow tried Google first, then Coral, and then the Wayback machine. All automatically.
Although there was little new information in this article, I found it to be a pretty good summary.
Not random -- certain imams used the cartoons as a lever to get support for a boycott of Danish goods... and it's basically exploded out of control. There is a LOT of latent anger in the Muslim world, whose source is not that hard to figure out.
Oh great, just what I need.  A complete, searchable archive of all my online chatting... :)

Conscience breaches of the law is exactly the problem here -- now that they know there are forbidden animals in the water, the have to do something about it.
It's pretty easy to detect a "shill bidding ring", if you will, with some simple graphs of connectedness among accounts. There is no need to filter based on the content of the websites.
The problem with allowing only a certian level of karma to perform certain actions is that you are biasing the site towards existing users, which may not be so wise given that people already complain about how those with higher karma seem to have more power (even though the rest of us know this isn't true).  Also, without other backend spam detection in place, it would be pretty easy to set up a bunch of accounts to vote each other up and boost each other's karma.

i love the diplomatic language of why anyone would want to go 'off the record'... ;-)
Agreed, if everyone loves bottled water and is prepared to spend extra for it why not use some of the proceeds (33% sounds a bit harsh) to help fund water supply and sanitation programmes?
The Middle East already prints &lt;a href="http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/arab/arab_media_cartoon_20060125.asp"&gt;plenty &lt;/a&gt; of anti-Semitic cartoons (the one I linked _barely_ scratches the surface). Yet I don't notice any of their embassies being torched -- including in Israel (Israel maintains relations with Jordan and Egypt, and has long maintained relations with Turkey -- despite the fact that Anti-Semitic caricatures can be found in their newspapers [including state sponsored ones] on a regular basis).

Denying the Holocaust is also *not illegal* in many European countries (e.g.: Denmark) as well as the United States -- while, it's likely that those where it *is* legal likely have (and enforce) laws against defamation of Muslims as well.

(Israel on the other hand, had also prosecuted a woman for drawing a cartoon mocking Muhammad and posting it on the front of an Arab store).

In short, this is more pathetic demagoguery coming from Iran -- and it's president, who no doubt, is doing this to create a highly negative reaction from the United States and Europe (in order to use that fact to trump up nationalism in support of himself, when clearly the youth of Iran does not connect very much to his political views).

But flouro lights, and any lights that rely on non black body radiation will always produce an inferior pseudo white light (its not really white, its just a sampling of different colours that looks white to our eyes). For some people, they cause headaches, they make things look pasty, or just wrong if you care about colours, and are generally unpleasant to work under.

I am not sure if white leds are better, perhaps they are ?
Indeed.  Stop link-whoring, you spamming asswipe.
Allegro also had an advertisement (complete with code examples) in the most recent issue of Dr. Dobbs. However, Allegro isn't a good competitor to the Java platform at the moment -- and I speak not for myself personally -- since the Java platform is almost entirely free/open-source software (including the Eclipse IDE). Allegro, however, is almost prohibitively priced.

Now I myself, will take emacs/slime and cliki any day over Java and it's platform (for the most part, I despise Java and what it stands for), but that combo isn't enough to convince "the industry" to join in on a Lisp-revival.

Yet, still it is pleasant to see Lisp again becoming a "buzzword" amongst the "suits".

Help! reddit users.  Digg is took my submitted link off the queue in short order.  Do they have a censorship or what?  What are they afraid of?  StockDigg.com is for stocks and investing while Digg.com is for tech news, and there is no conflict of interest here, is there?
I think this article is misguided, in that it overlooks the fact that most of the heat produced by lightbulbs is
simply not wasted: it just contributes to the heating which in many ways is necessary anyway. This is certainly true for most domestic lighting in higher latitudes, where early darkness (winter evenings) coincide with lower outside temperatures.

How is an interesting article less interesting by having been unread and unknown for a longer time?

Sure, if it's actual news news that's less interesting later, but this is just arguing for a relatively timeless point in the first place.

Haha!  Spolsky...mod this man up immediately!
To me, a "controversial" page listing pages with a large number of votes positive plus negative might be more interesting. Sometime you submit something, and first it goes up to five then it goes back down to one, so you know it has a high absolute score, even if the relative score is only bleh.

Maybe instead of a separate "recommend v. prefer" system, Reddit should just start using the hide button in that manner. So, for you (and me), when you see a Guy Kawasaki article, after you plus, you also hit "hide", and reddit can learn that you like the content in general, but don't want to see the article in particular for some other reason (that I'm already subscribed and read-it), and trains itself to find you similar articles but maybe not on that domain or whatever. OTOH, a vote down plus hide would be equivalent to a SPAM rating.
No, never heard of MG or TP.  To be honest I read very little.  I find it hard to think clearly when I read other people's work.  I'm really very easily influenced.  (not joking)  I even have a theory that mass publication might not be morally correct but that's another story.  And I have little free time.  That explains why I only skimmed the posted article.  I was actually happily surprised to hear that we might agree.  Doesn't happen often.

Is there one publicly available from a mainstream newspaper on the web? I am completely against the lunatic response from the Islamafia and I do support freedom of expression. However, I do believe that no prominent western media outlet would have the guts to publish any denial of the holocaust, except in reference, freedom of expression or not.
The BBC also cover the story [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4688000.stm), with  [photos](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4688330.stm).
&gt; they are some of the least racist, most open to non-whites, most generous and universally compassionate people. 

&gt; they donate a huge amount of money, every year, to non-white poor people

Even if we were to accept your stereotype as being correct, is that kind of behaviour really such a bad thing to aspire to? You seem to be suggesting that anyone who views the world with an open mind and rejects racism is somehow naïve.

&gt; So I'm quite happy all this is going on; I just hope the muslims do something much worse soon enough, so that the lesson really sinks in.

I find your lack humanity incredible. So we should all hope for death and the loss of innocent life? Would you willing to accept the murder of your friends and family so that "the lesson really sinks in"?

As I said above, your criticism of tolerance and desire for bloodshed seems to suggest that you have more in common with your "enemies" than you seem to realise.
Wow

When exposure to conservatives and their views becomes the talking heads on news-come-entertainment, right wing blogs that don't care what the facts are, GOP politicians and ideologues, a president who scores votes with a simple guy next door routine, and an army of flag-wavers posting drivel on the internet, it becomes hard to afford right wing views any sort of credibility above emotive appeal.

To hear a Bush supporting conservative who thinks, is doing so with experience to draw from, and who can and will _speak to us candidly_ on many topics, it's a whole new experience.

"Fine in theory, but with the multitude of shapes and sizes of incandescent bulbs, its not changing bulbs that is the problem, its the cost of changing the fittings as well. And how about dimmers - few of them work with discharge bulbs

Here's something I recently learned about Linux and memory that has saved my 600MHz silent (no fans) PC, never use swap!  It kills performance.  Use "top" to measure "swap used".  If not zero then run the following as root to reclaim swap space.  (Just like the Karate Kid.)

/sbin/swapoff -a

/sbin/swapon -a

Best to check swap usage in the morning, after the "locate" db has been updated.  If anything will push you into using swap, that update process will.  A runaway Firefox is the next most likely culprit.

Note:  If you are truly low on memory then the attempt to reclaim swap will have no effect.

The article also suggests that the 14-hour showdown in the Laakkwartier in The Hague was to get Mohammed Bouyeri, who was in fact arrested within minutes after he killed Theo van Gogh - he tried to die in a shoot-out with the police. In the Laakkwartier only people of the Hofstad group were arrested, of which Mohammed Bouyeri was also a member.
The Reputation system should take care of it.. problem is you don't know someones reputation when browsing the "new page".. I just submitted this [possible solution](http://reddit.com/info?id=1be2) it suggests that karma is displayed when you post.

Hm, I'm not even sure that is their Prophet... the author of those sketches usually doesn't comment them, but rather lets people envision what they choose.
Maybe that's exactly the point: is that Muhammad, or not? As many people have stressed out, how could anyone really tell, since depicting him is so taboo?
As I see it, it's just a (smart) ridicule of the way *some* people from the Islam responded to drawings with violence. Also, it reassures us of our right to free speech, as long as we live in a country that embraces this right.

Actually, I didn't even think that was Muhammad when I first saw the cartoon - different viewers, different perspectives :)

Ayatollah Khamenei condemns drawings as Zionist conspiracy:

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060207.w2proph0206/BNStory/International/home

I chuckled at this quote: The caricatures amounted to a "conspiracy by Zionists who were angry because of the victory of Hamas," he said, referring to the Palestinian militant group that won a surprise landslide victory in last month's elections.

Someone should remind him that the caricatures were published in September 2005. Or maybe he knows this and is implying that the Zionists have mastered time travel?
Compact what?  That's so 1980's.  Try LEDs now.
I vote for pulling out low scoring articles and users, however, make sure the threshold is not going to hurt "unlucky" posters.

Based on that, could we have a "Dislike all articles of this user" button? Preferably on the user's page. That way it's easier to vote down all articles of a spammer, with just one click.

&gt; I don't agree with your examples, because Muslims have a right to be offended about religious things.

They do have a right to be offended, but they don't have a right to react the way that many have and start murdering people, rioting, and destroying things over it.
&gt; The same people who are currently trying to get flag burning illegalized, would be steadily trying to get anti-Cristian/sacreligious speech illegalied here if our Constitution was not in place to guarantee the right.

There is also a large contingent of folk that would like to get rid of Christian speech that is negative towards any certain people groups.
Yeah, that list still pales in comparison to terrorist acts by Muslims.

Heck I could find "atheist" acts of terrorism, but they are largely isolated cases, and its not something that happens *all the time*.
"But I hope it goes on and on -- I hope the Danes get a long hard lesson in how these folks behave. "
is like saying
"I hope that somebody betrays your trust, so that you'll realise you made a mistake in trusting them." Wouldn't it be better to say, "I hope someone rewards your trust so that you will be justified in having trusted them."


I guess you can't detect sarcasm, either.  The grandparent post was intended as humor.

The fact of the matter is that Islam is a religion of violent hegemony.  American's are bowing down to the god of Tolerance, and living in fear that maybe the Muslims will do to America what a certain ethnic minority did when Katrina destroyed their city.

When the gulf countries run out of oil we're all screwed. 90% of the industrial worlds population starve to death, everyone else goes back to pre-industrial rural economy.
The difference between Christians and Muslims is that when people who espouse to be Christians go on vigilante killing sprees, it is in conflict with the very beliefs they profess to believe (having identified themselves with Christ), whereas when Muslims go on vigilante killing sprees, it is in harmony with the very beliefs they profess to believe (having put themselves under the authority of the Koran).

Please refer to http://www.wvinter.net/~haught/Koran.html
Yeah, that makes sense! Some Danish non-jews (as far as we know) make some cartoons that infuriates the Muslims and they decide to take revenge on the Jews.

Good point they would have to be a pretty dedicated spammer, however "new page" browsers would hopefully be able to identify the pattern, even with a new account if he keeps posting spam, "new page" browsers would simply keep demoting him, ensuring that his time spamming here is wasted.

If all works out, the spammer would just stop posting here because it's not worth his time.

That's a pretty trivial complaint expressed in alot of words.  Besides helping a community is not just measured in number of jobs. How many people have used craigslist to get an appartment cheaper?

How many dollars exchanged hands locally rather than being diverted to ebay?

Did you know that this actually is a "piece of art"?

It's made by a fellow Belgian, [Wim Delvoye](http://www.time.com/time/europe/generatione/mediums/delvoye.html). He asked some of his friends to paint parts of their bodies with small amounts of barium and then have sex in actual medical clinics. On the resulting [(se)X-rays](http://artnet.com/artwork/151038/Wim_Delvoye_Pipe_1.html), you can clearly see that the human male has no [baculum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculum) or penis bone (sorry, I just had to show off that I'm a biologist ;)

At exhibitions, the X-rays are presented as [giant stained-glass church windows](http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/works/record.html?record=1477). At a distance you admire the abstract forms, but it is only when you come closer and study it in detail that you see what it is composed of.

(He used this trick before in his 1992 work "[Mosaic](http://images.google.com/images?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&amp;amp;q=delvoye%20mosaic&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi)". The work consists of glazed tiles bearing an identical image, arranged to form symmetrical and highly ornate patterns. It is only on closer inspection that you realize that on each tile, you see 2 turds -the artist's own excrement!)

The scatological interests of Wim Delvoye are even more clear in his latest instalment: [Cloaca](http://www.cloaca.be), a machine that was "fed" an exquisite meal twice a day, and -mimicking the working of the intestines- produced a fresh pile of shit every day. Which was then sold for hard cash.
I found no problems using Gmail with Opera 8.5 and Opera's own user agent identification string. As for they hype, in this case it is rather justified. Unlike some of Google's more lacklustre recent offerings, Gmail is extremely well designed, especially in comparison to its rivals. While AJAX has probably received undue attention, in the case of Gmail it really does make a significant difference to user experience.

Naturally you wouldnt give a guy negative Karma if he's only submitted a couple articles.

But if a guy constantly has -20 ratings on every post he submits obviously he's up to something. I'm sure the reddit guys could set it so that it's fair.
I wrote the author an email.  It went:  First of all, in most markets, he doesn't charge anything.  If a newspaper can't stand on it's own two feet without a distribution monopoly (or duopoly) then it shouldn't exist.  We have a funny thing called free markets in America and while not perfect or complete they seem to work better than central planning.

Second, they're working on something new and news related that might just help fledgling journalists and bloggers, but you didn't mention that so I assume you either chose to omit it or just didn't do your research.  Go bloggers.
I'm with mnemonicsloth. It's ridiculous to suggest that the government should enforce such a regulation. This might fly in the UK, but I don't think it'll get much support on this side of the pond.

Something about this rubs me the wrong way. Namely, that I can chat with someone, have their words in plaintext on my screen, and yet that person has the ability to prevent me from keeping a log. Will I be able to copy and paste into a text file? Or will I have to take a screen shot, run it through OCR software, and save it that way. It seems like a stupid "feature" and it makes complicated what should be simple.

I have to wonder if they realize on a conscious level that they are undermining their industry by taking the originality out.

It is a classic example of everyone for themselves.  Everyone is only concerned with their own profit motives, so their entire industry as a whole suffers for it.

It seems to me that LED's would be much better overall than CF bulbs, which aren't *that* much more efficient than incandescent and are considered hazardous waste where I live.  Are LED's a practical option yet, or are they still so pricey that they can only make sense in special cases?
There was a bit of contraversy in the Washington D.C. area a couple years back.  I don't have links, you'll have to do some research yourself.

At any rate, the EPA standards for safe water aren't quite what you might think.  The local water company had to test houses for lead levels in the water supply.  According to the regulations, as long as less than 25% of the houses had lead levels above the limit, that was OK.

The kicker is that even if _your_ house was above the limit, they didn't have to tell you that.

I guess there is no substitute for getting your water supply tested in a lab.  And checking the local regulations.  It's your life.
[deleted]
This is really a bullshit argument.  If people WANTED to use local newspapers, they would.  

Also, there's nothing stopping local newspapers from creating local craigslist like sites.  They could advertise it locally, allow free posting on the web, and charge a little to get it in print (or maybe also in a rotation on the front page or something), but I haven't seen one doing it.
I know. They're quite comparable, and they both piss me off.

I walk a lot through downtown Oakland each day, and, yes, they are slobs.  For reasons I cannot fathom, it's "cool" to litter here.  I've seen countless people just toss what they no longer need on the ground.  It's mostly the young, but not only.  I get tired of arguing with people about it, so I just shutup now.  The #1 peeve I have: smokers tossing their butts on the ground, thinking the entire fucking city is their ashtray.  WTF?

(There are a lack of garbage cans downtown, which I think is a contributing factor.  The city is saying "we don't want your garbage", so just toss it on the ground.)

As many of us already know, sometimes it's possible to love doing lots of different things. Yet so often the implied question is &gt;What [one thing!] do you want to be when you grow up?  What [single] color is your parachute&gt;?  I call people with "too many interests" Renaissance Souls, pointing out that being a Renaissance Soul is a *fact, not a flaw*!  When people grasp this, they respond with the most incredibly moving emails about how they finally don't feel &gt;broken,&lt; &gt;odd,&gt; or the infamous &gt;Jack of all trades, master of none&gt; anymore.  But there still are way too many out there who are not aware of this affirming concept. This makes the book *THE RENAISSANCE SOUL: Life Design for People With Too Many Passions to Pick Just One* a great partner book to Graham's.  The more of us who spread the word re Renaissance Souls via blogs, online book reviews, links on their sites, etc. the more people we can reach with this affirming paradigm shift. This is definitely going to be a word-of-mouth process since much of the media still haven’t caught on to the power of this information and the number of people out there searching for it! Likewise, Random House/Broadway, publishers of my book, have only allocated the minimum of funds for publicity.   So thanks in advance for anything you do to help the concept of Renaissance Souls reach its tipping point!
It has to be socially negotiated; it has to be a decision between the two chatters.  They can't go "off the record" unless you agree too, or at least the way I'm reading it.
Nobody is forcing the people of Burlington, VT--or wherever Craigslist is--to use the service. They use it because presumably they like it better than the alternatives. 

If you don't like Craigslist, don't use it. If you don't like Starbucks or Home Depot, then don't go there. But if lots of other people do like these establishments, then what can you really say? I guess you can complain a lot about how people have their priorities mixed up. But you can't just force everyone to feel exactly the same way you do.
The holocaust is one of the more touchy subjects in terms of free speech in the "free world".

IIRC There are laws in france and germany prohibiting the sale/dissemination of nazi doctrine (ie. mein kampft et al ).

Not sure if it made it into law, but holocaust denial attaches a *massive* stigma to any proponents.

So in the eyes of the offended islamists (anti-zionists?) the holocaust is the easiest and best target for like-for-like retalitation.
Christopher Hitchens.... even when I agree with him I hate him.
LEDs are *expensive*, and here's why:

1. You make 'em on wafers, which means you've got to go through a couple of cycles of {bake, photoresist, develop, dope, anneal, etch}.  Each one of those requires big infrastructure (furnaces, ion implanters), nasty chemicals (chemical-weapons-grade nasty in sometimes), and it all has to be done in a cleanroom.  This is going to be like making solar panels, but more expensive because silicon semiconductors don't emit light, and light-emitting semiconductor materials (gallium, indium) are much more difficult to work with.

2. When you're done, you wind up with a few wafers on the order of four square feet.  Even if you get a 10:1 area improvement from packaging and mounting the dice (that's plural for "die", i.e. chip), you still put in a lot more effort than you would to produce an equivalent number of incandescent lightbulbs -- even if your LEDs last 10 times as long.

3. LEDs like DC at low voltage, optimally about 0.7 volts.  Existing electrical apparatus is 180V AC.  I can elaborate on this topic for a looong time if anyone is curious :-)  Suffice it to say that you have to either accept a shorter lifetime for your diodes by having them turn on &amp; off all the time (wasting power too) or you have to convert your power into low-voltage/high-current, which dissipates a lot of heat.  The other option is to have a little DC voltage regulator for each diode -- which means more silicon, see #1 above.

4. The light is nasty -- all monochrome.  We only get a few colors to mix together, and it's harder than with fluorescent lights because you're "mixing" discrete solid-state devices instead of different gases in a tube.  [this link](http://ledmuseum.home.att.net/ledrgb.htm) is kind of interesting if you're interested.

So unfortunately, LEDs are prbably never going to be uesful as light sources except for things like emergency flashlights -- small amounts of light to keep your rod-vision working, rather than large amounts of light to saturate your environment and keep you in a good mood.
Good lord. Open your eyes. You are being manipulated, just as the Muslims are being manipulated by their imams, who are playing on *their* prejudices as much as the media is playing on yours. The Op-Ed reads like those WWII articles about the "savage Japs", and you are lapping it up like a good soldier.

What they are doing is intolerable. Violence is intolerable. So is willful ignorance, such as you painting an entire cluture of hundreds of millions of people with one brush. In fact, it's the ignorance that leads to the violence.
Me fail english?

but Steve, while that sounds good and all, it doesn't necessarily correlate.  What about newer users that are still on the learning curve and are just starting to figure out what a good article submission is?  Sure, those that blanket a ton of crap articles are one thing, but simply equating a low-scoring user or article with spam isn't the right solution.

I know you're not actually proposing that all low-scoring users be automagically marked as "spam," but I just wanted to make a point.  Call it arguing semantics.
Hehe. You win. The CDs are of course not manufactured by SunnComm, however they do develop the DRM which the products on the list are infected by.

Any why not buy DRM infected products? Well, I'm sure there's a long list on some thousands blogs out there. For me, these are most important:

- It has proved to cause malfunction to both software and hardware in the past (Try Googling "sony rootkit")

- I don't want DRM products, and thus choose to exercise my consumer power by not buying them.

I wonder how many people expressing the sensible view of "if you don't like it, don't use it" would express the same view of a Wal-Mart or whatever.

Heat from lighting floats upwards to the ceiling (convection) and does nor significantly contribute to room warmth - that's why the heating vents are placed on the floor.

I agree with the author! 

And I also wish the scribes hadn't lost their monopoly on the written word.  

If I have to listen to another newspaper man using his newspaper to cry and whine about this, I'll puke.
The problem with Starbucks and Home Depot is that often, after a few years there's nowhere else left to go.

There's no good reason the local newspaper couldn't have started its own community site before Craigslist moved in. It's not exactly hard to write the code for that kind of site, and it's not a new idea; Craigslist has been around over 10 years. If you get everyone using your community site before Craigslist opens a page for your town, you can charge a *small* fee for some of the more popular categories.
Alright, so this is just like when the WWII media wrote about "savage Japs". I'll take your premise.

So then, you think it would have been better to do nothing about the real Japanese threat in WWII and let their Empire conquer and subjugate Manchuria, China, and possibly as much of the world as they could?

Or should we have fought back against an enemy and tried to defend ourselves?

The Japanese weren't evil, the Muslim countries are not evil.

The Japanese, however, did decide before WWII that they were better than everybody else and that they will go ahead and prove this by conquering as much of Asia and the world as they could and imposing their rule on the people living there.

That's exactly what the Muslims want to do now. Their leaders, quite often, have proclaimed that they want to destroy us and cover the entire world with their brand of fascist fanatical Islam where all Jew and Chrisitians will be killed, and all women subjugated.

We need to show them, quite clearly, that this isn't going to happen.

And then, when they've acknowledged our right to exist and do what we want to do in our own countries, they will be as welcomed into the world community as the Japanese are now.
&gt; Perhaps you have just misread...

Likely.  I think we got confused somewhere.  For the record -- since network-delivered text often fails to activate our empathic-social-interaction ganglia -- when I'm verbalizing these posts to myself as I write them, I use a civil tone :-)


But I've got to take issue with one of your quotes, on the grounds that it contains assumptions that privilege an atheistic viewpoint:

&gt; &gt; Skeptics engaged in debate with apologists tend to expect apologetics to consist of powerful arguments intended to persuade skeptics, and are sometimes surprised by the failure of these arguments to even approach this goal. Occasionally, it's because the **apologist just isn't any good**. Most often, though, it's because the arguments only had the purpose of giving **current believers license to continue believing.** Since skeptics are not the intended target at all, these arguments **aim for a much lower burden,** not trying to do more than make the religious belief plausible or cast doubt on skeptical arguments.  (emphasis is mine)

I read that as: "Some apologetics aren't very good, and others are less interested in truth than in propping up their preconceptions."  This isn't debate, it's genteel mud-slinging, and since it purports to explian the "Intellectual and Social Function" of a whole *class* of people, you could even call it bigoted.






&gt; ...in the modern sense of the word 'god', where all that is left of god is a concept that by definition can not be reasoned about

How do you separate things are subject to reason ('reasonable') from things that are not ('unreasonable')?  Certainly the status of being neither demonstably true nor demonstrably false is insufficient to declare that an idea unreasonable.  In mathematics, the Axiom of Choice ('C') falls into this category -- some theorists assert C, others assert not-C, and both are reasonable.  The existence of real numbers (i.e. limits, calculus) is predicated on the former choice, and much important work in computability theory rests on the latter.

So I think you have to do some more work than just claiming that 'god' is a malformed idea.  Some people seem able to assume the existence of actors or agentive observers involved in the origin of the universe, and reason effectively (if not always correctly) from there.  Other people assert that there are no such entities, and reason effectively (if not always correctly) from there.  Both systems of thinking occasionally produce interesting results, and both systems could turn out to be wrong (if, for example, the universe has no beginning or end in time).  Where's the problem?

The apt point contained in the cartoon is this: the idolaters are the people who act as if these images have religious meaning.

The prohibition on depicting the prophet is there to prevent what their ignorant asses are doing.
Short answer: LEDs are, in principle, even more monochromatic than fluorescent bulbs.

I think that in this context you have to assume people are willing to pay extra for the new bulb, whether it's LED or CF or something else.  If so, they can get fluorescents with better phosphors and ballasts that all but eliminate the pasty white flickering light of cheap fluorescents.  In the near term, the extra cost of LEDs is never recovered in energy savings compared to using CF bulbs.

In some cases, it's cheaper to make an LED that emits UV and coat it with phosphors, than to blend a few colors of LED to try and get "white" light.  It is an active area of research though, and I expect we'll be switching to LEDs within ten years.

"Oh, sure, Craig's giving people what they want and we're not.  And it's totally true that we've had  a decade to figure this out on our own and we haven't.  And Craig's been around for a while, so we could have emulated him before he got huge and crushed us, but we didn't feel like it.  And everybody knows that Craig's business got started by accident, so the demand for it must really have been huge for it to grow so quickly all on its own.  **But**.  But everyone should ignore him and pay attention to us because we're *so, so special*."

Fans of Jim Morrison and Fred Chopin might enjoy viewing this film it shows their graves.  It is a quick visual tour of the older part of Paris France showing familiar and unfamiliar sites. It has the Eiffel tower but also has a view up the elevator shaft to the top. This site also has a link to a site that has the movie as well a map and a list of the sites shown in the film. This film could be helpful if planning a trip to Paris or just a souvenir of a previous visit. Of added interest is the soundtrack which was computer composed in the style of french accordion music as still heard in the Metro.
If people are upset enough to care, they'll buy their coffee from other people.  They might even get bored and trade in lattes for some other fad.  In my town, the SBUX went out of business last year and got replaced by a hookah bar.
Exactly right.

The way this *should* work is: energy prices should rise when generators are being pushed to the limit, causing homes and businesses to wish to conserve energy during precisely those times when energy is scarce. Then all those people would eventually buy fluorescent bulbs of their own accord.

Unfortunately, in Ontario at least, residential electricity prices are being controlled by the government. No politician could get elected on a plan to eliminate these price controls, so people get the wrong price signal on electricity.

Oh! - but we could fix this problem by making it illegal to buy incandescent light bulbs! People in possession of them would be sent to work camps for the rest of their lives. In fact, why stop there? Why not plan the whole economy? That's always worked in the past, right?

I disagree on both points. As a user, I think the purity of Reddit's ranking system is a big part of what makes it a good site. Sure, I've wanted to rewrite somebody's title, or un-linkjack a post, but I don't think giving people that ability just because they constantly watch RSS feeds for joelonsoftware.com and paulgraham.com so they can get karma is a good idea[0]. I don't think giving popular users the ability to edit other people's posts would cause geek articles to score any higher than they do currently. I suspect, if anything, hackers are more likely to be fair moderators.

Western countries want to rule the world too. Most of them *did* at some point. How many times have governments been overthrown because their leaders were not properly obedient to the US or the Soviet Union? The current US president is not shy about his plans to subvert the governments of many countries around the world. Always for the best of reasons, you understand. Always.

The problem isn't Muslims -- the problem is governments of *all stripes* trying to rule the world. To that end, they use propaganda to turn their people against the current enemy; to think of them as less than human. If Muslims are not evil, calling them evil, uncivilized, etc, as many people are doing, is false, right? Is it acceptable to just "go with" a dangerous lie? Not to me.

During WWII, tens of thousands of US citizens were rounded up &amp; their lives destroyed simply because they were Japanese. The United States is the first &amp; only country to use nuclear weapons on a civilian population. And that's supposedly the war with the *least* moral ambiguity! 

War degrades everybody. Are you seriously saying we should go through that again? Just roll over and take it because standing up and thinking for yourself is too damned hard? Are you *sure* that we are not being pushed as much as they are?

Well, that's true.  I saw an article a few days ago about virtual card numbers; I had never heard of them before, heh.  They do sound interesting and useful, but with the services offered to most consumers by most card companies, it is rather easy to not be held liable for purchases made with a stolen number.

With that being said, sans a virtual number, you would probably have to get a new card number and a new card, which would be a pain.  Maybe virtual card numbers are more than just a niche convenience, after all...
WOW!  This is going to be great!

But alternative newsweeklies *did* invent it. It's always big business/government/pressure groups vs. "the community".

There is a HUGE gulf between "wide scale (and angry) protests" and the type of violence that is taking place in multiple countries in Europe and the Middle East.  They aren't at all comparable. I would be ecstatic to see the muslim mobs peacefully demonstrating.  

"that was more due to the order of our society than the the [sic] protesters controlling themselves."  It is notable that you offer no argument or evidence whatsoever to back up this rather strong assertion.  If it were true, then why weren't Christians in societies less ordered than ours resorting to violence?  After all, we haven't seen peaceful demonstrations confined to 'ordered' Denmark, have we?

CFL tubes contain mercury. So, they will probably be banned for environmental concerns, anyway. mnemonicsloth' argument that LEDs are impractical versus CFL due to fab costs, is a bit odd... The CFL lamps use an IC controller, so similar issues apply. (for example, http://tinyurl.com/7vtv5 has an IC, two MOSFETs, four diodes and a transorb).
The problem is government subsidies -- if the cost of power reflected the true cost of production (including wars, etc.) we'd have more conservation. Banning W is silly.
The article says: "In the first place, it wouldn't actually matter if it were true [that we have a shortage of folks who know math and science in the US]. The whole point of the international division of labor is that we benefit from the skills of everyone around the world."

I really suspect that we don't want to be on the 'countries that don't do math and science' end of this equation.  This whole 'international division of labor' things seems like a bad idea, really.  It seems that we have people who have a variety of skills, interests, and abilities in the US (or any nation for that matter) and to say "Oh, you're good at math and science, well you'd best move to China or India because those are the places that specialize in those skills, here we do marketing" is a very bad idea.  If you believe in this international division of labor then it basically means that in any nation you'll have large numbers of people who won't be able to 'fit' into a highly specialized society which has no room for their skills.  It also means that if some disaster comes up where you can't communicate or trade with other regions for a time, your country will not be able to get essential goods or services.  (think avian flu, for example, we don't make basic medical supplies like masks, gloves, needles, even medicines here anymore, so if we find that Asia is hit hard by h2h transmission of avian flu our hospitals will quickly run out of these supplies).

As for the Nazis, ever heard of Dietrich Bonhoeffer?  Perhaps the most famous anti-Nazi (he was executed for speaking out) of all and he was a minister. Outside of Germany, Christians who supported the Nazis were an abberation.  Besides, this example is 60 years old.  Let's talk about today.

If any Christian is suggesting that bad things have never been done in the name of Christ, then I'll be the first to call them a moron. But let's not pretend that in this day and age the amount of violence done directly in the name of Christianity is equivalent to that done in the name of Islam.
It's important to note that they're talking about *mitochondrial* DNA.  The mitochondria are the cell's energy factories.  They have no influence (AFAIK) on the shape of the animal -- you can't make a mammoth from it.  They need the nuclear DNA for that.

One of the key things that the author missed is that on a home system, usually the user has root access, so most of the security of having seperation of privliges is lost.  In OSX, it is trivial for any program to get root, because all it has to do is pop up that little box that says "This program is requesting system access, please enter your password" which most every user does without even realizing what they are really doing is ginving sudo access to the program.
What a weird story. It felt made up and leaves too many questions unanswered. Potentially fascinating if true.

First, let me agree that there is not a shortage of people with science degrees.  Then let me immediately emphasize that there is a shortage of skilled engineers and scientists.  I see two reasons for this, and despite my love for the free market, government intervention could in theory actually help (it probably won't, but that's because of the incompetence of our government, not because it's a bad idea). 

First, some capable Americans do not have the opportunity to study science.  Like a nerd born in Poetistan, some potential engineers are born in school districts that inhibit, rather than promote, math and science education.  Generally, the fact that a school district has a problem is a sign that no market force will correct the problem--the parents and teachers in the district teach it in a painful way because to them it is painful.

Second, capable Americans with the opportunity to study science or engineering are almost always better off going into business.  If science was very specialized, then the specialization/division of labor argument makes sense.  But in the real world, it's not a question between poetry and math, it's a question between applying rational thought to chemistry/biology/physics or business, and most people who are capable of science are also capable of things that make more money.  

External forces (like the government) are capable of affecting both problems:  they can find/fund good science teachers, and they can artificially reward science over business.  The reason politicians will screw up any attempt at doing either of those is because there is no measure for "good" science, so you don't know if a teacher is a good science teacher, and when you attract capable people headed for business and incapable people headed nowhere, you award degrees to all of them (and cause unemployment among PhDs).

My solution?  Well, this post is long enough already...
strike the 'might' - this specific problem is definitely fixable.  Let user karma go negative, and factor user karma into article placement in at least the recommended page.  If you also require a captcha on user registration, then it will take most of the spammers out entirely.  Another promising candidate is to have a domain-level average-paulgraham.com would have an average of 300, and any site average below -N would get flagged/just not submitted.

The more general problem of making spam go away is pretty hard.  I think the way to do it is to let people set up filters on submitter karma, and then enough people will set the filter above 2 that the spammer would have to do real work to get in.

Another way to go is to make the default page recommended instead of hot.  This would require making recommended better, of course.

Could somebody clarify: are all votes equal, or do voters with higher karma have more influential votes? There are a lot of claims and counter-claims on this in the comments (and in this article) &amp; it would be nice to know.

(please *don't* answer unless you know for certain: so not based on what you remember some guy saying in some comment somewhere a few months back...)
Souter lives in a section of town that was originally going to be a separate town, called North Weare.  It did not secede or incorporate or whatever, but it is still called North Weare.  People who live there call it NoWeare, like NoHo/SoHo, not "nowhere".  Other than that, I think it was all correct.  Incidentally, I lived in almost exactly the geographic center of NoWeare, so I quite literally lived in the middle of...never mind.
The last attempted clinic bombing I'm aware of was on 16 Sep 2004. In 2001 there were over 500 Anthrax threats. The Mormon war is an historical event. Look it up.

So now we are playing a game of "whose religion is more depraved". Well, mine only had two lynchings and and a sniper last year, so it's ok to call you uncivilized. What tripe. 

Let go of the hate, man. Recognize that you are being manipulated into thinking that Muslims cannot have the same fears &amp; motivations as you do. Their leaders are working as hard to manipulate them as this jerk Jacoby is to manipulate you.

A problem I have with this article is that it seems to make the assumption that everyone is rational and has perfect knowledge.  It seems to me that the reason that one says something like "we are running out of mathematicians and scientists and we need them" is to fight the people saying, "no one should be a mathematician or scientist because your job will just go to India."  The purpose is to sway public opinion into thinking that these are worthwhile jobs again.  There isn't any real messing with market forces.

It is really just a move to get people to remember that we will always need mathematicians and scientists and there will always be jobs for them in America, regardless of India.
This article reminded me of a lecture by Leonard Peikoff on government involvement in healthcare.

Heh, the countries with strong laws against Holocaust denial (France, Germany, and I believe Russia -- not sure if Holocaust denial is prohibited, but I do recall it is illegal to own a copy of Mein Kampf in Russia) are some of the "softest" (relatively speaking) in Regards to Iran. 

I think the Holocaust denial angle is what may have pushed Russia into condemning Iraq (with the UN vote etc..) -- while Russia no longer has a large Jewish community, 14 million Russian civilians were killed by Germans so they're not going to take lightly to any diminuition of Nazi evil.

Denmark, where the cartoons were published, does *not* have laws against Holocaust denial. So in turn a) Iran's desired response would not happen b) Iran printing Holocaust cartoons is nothing out of the ordinary given anti-Semetic caricatures that appear on a regular basis in Middle Eastern press c) this will only further alienate Iran from any sympathyit may have had in Europe (especially France, Germany and Russia).

*No one claimed that people laughed non-stop for 6 months.*

I know; that's what I meant when I said it was "implausible."  But the first answer he gave implied, and would leave an unbiased reader to believe, that it was 6 continuous months of yucks because he didn't add any qualifiers until later.
All votes are equal.
Well, there you go.  So now the question is:  why?

Now Jews will vandalize property and assault people in response to cartoons. The world will see that any group of people resonds to offensive speech with violence just like Muslims do. This *is* Iran's plan, right?
Don't you know? That's how they can claim that Israel existed as a Jewish state PRIOR to both the first use of the word "Palestine" and the invention of Islam.
Why not?
You are making a valid point: it sure isn't the first time cartoons depicting Islam dogmas in less than favourable ways are showed, and they sure aren't the most offensive ones. Not to mention that they were printed in *September last year*!
The (chosen?) timing of this outburst is suspicious, to say the least.

"other less influential users will frequently attach themselves to the growth trend of a post and drive it higher in the rankings"

I don't buy this.  People vote for what they actually like and dislike.  That's the beauty of the system.
But most people tend to select posts to vote for or against only from what is already in the first few pages of the hot section.  So what's hot might become hotter, but it only gets hot because of the early influencers.

And the reason of shortage is government regulation, not free market. if you had free market in schools there would not be shortage in engineers. Unless beeing a nuclear scientist is such a loosy low-paid job you leave it to Chineese.

Many actually praise the planned, command aspects of the US's economy for this, for instance Bill Gates's dad:

*"Let's talk about the question of why people are wealthy. There is a myth that it's a function of enormous personal attributes. There's a myth that achieving wealth is a function of personal intelligence and energy and thus that the product of that intelligence and energy being wealth is the sole and exclusive possession of the person who developed and earned it. And that myth is so egregious. It's just egregious.(...)*

*"The individual wealth which is generated in this economy is, in my judgment, and I doubt that there is much that anyone could disagree with about this, is a function of the innovative businesses which are created as a result of federal research. But you understand that the people who benefit from that research get it free. (...) So, if somebody starts a software company or a biotechnology company, or even if somebody owns a building in downtown Washington which you rent to those people, it starts from the same place. It starts from this incredible research activity which is going on with federal money."*
-- [Bill Gates Sr., 2003](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/template.cfm?PubID=900584)

An [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/02/technology/02darpa.html?ex=1270094400&amp;en=6ca69efefeb9c0dc&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt) explains that federal research (under military spending) was vital for the US tech economy. (Ironically, it ends with a quote from Lisp guy John McCarthy, seeing that reddit has lots of Lisp articles.)

For those who prefer the other ideological end of the spectrum, [Chomsky](http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featchomsky_63_p.htm) and [other leftists](http://www.counterpunch.org/schaefer08132003.html) analyze in detail these high-tech federal subsidies. With essentially the same conclusions as above, though claiming that there should have been more democratic control over where this spending went, as they probably consider people like Gates's son leeches. However, many claim that that some form of federal spending is vital for the economy, even in the form of military, as the economy would fail otherwise.
&gt;the fact that a school district has a problem is a sign that no market force will correct the problem

Could it be that schools are not good enogh because they are "public"?

&gt;they can artificially reward science over business

when you "regulate" best people from business to science you no longer have enough skilled people in business. This artifical shortage will need compensation too.. Intervention is not the answer.

The malice is that the soldier had to pay for a clerical error that he had nothing to do with (as he was shot and unable to properly document everything that happened).

One pump and here come the pirates.
I'm usure of whether you think I'd get positive or negative karma. I considered submitting it but expected negative karma if I did so (I've been downmodded for explaining that a company earning high profits is not theft.) 
If you are thinking you'll get positive karma... thanks for your politeness but you can go ahead and post it - good luck if you do.
Can you recommend a good filter?
that is true, but I don't think that is what the_seanald ment...
Uhhh...what are you talking about?  There are many Christian  idiots who say horrid things about any number of groups of people, eg. jews, muslims, gays, etc., etc., ad nauseum.  I am not aware of widespread calls to stop these instances of christian speech.

Are you talking about getting Intelligent Design out of schools?  If so, that is not being removed because it is offensive.
Made up is correct. This isn't fucking weight watchers. It's a hospital. The whole thing reads like some fetish writing. The goal was to treat a mental condition. Gained 3 stone! My god the horror! I'd rather think the house plants can converse with me than gain weight!


Yeah, because iPods are clearly fundamental basic science. that's what science is for, building shiny toys.

Many people accept that division of labor carries useful benefits. But it has dire consequences which should be understood.

Adam Smith [claimed](http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN20.html#B.V,%20Ch.1,%20Of%20the%20Expences%20of%20the%20Sovereign%20or%20Commonwealth) that under division of labor, workers eventually become *"as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether incapable of judging, and unless very particular pains have been taken to render him otherwise, he is equally incapable of defending his country in war. The uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him regard with abhorrence the irregular, uncertain, and adventurous life of a soldier. It corrupts even the activity of his body, and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employment than that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expence of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it."*

Here's a [globalization faq](http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan2000albert.htm) from the leftists -- these leftists seem to believe wholeheartedly in globalization, but not the specific kind we usually hear about in the press.

(Also, we should look at the one sentence in Adam Smith's most famous book where he actually mentions the invisible hand. *"By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."* So we need a nuanced, non-religious understanding as to what he really intended with the invisible hand metaphor.)
yeah, something is obviously missing from such unpopular, unused sites as /., digg, reddit, flikr, delicious.
This site contains a blog about two sexy Sarasota women (one of whom is single) and their experiences with going out, nightlife and dating in Sarasota, Florida. Our site guarantees that visitors return again and again - this isn't just a static pixel billboard that gets forgotten after the press dies down.
"They also reveal the million hectare forest covering the Foja Mountain range in the Indonesian part of New Guinea..."

I'm guessing because the article refers to it as the Indonesian part of New Guinea? :-)
&gt; strike the 'might' - this specific problem is definitely
&gt; fixable. Let user karma go negative, and factor user karma
&gt; into article placement in at least the recommended page.

Or, even better, compare (some function of) user karma against a user's filter setting to determine whether they ever see postings from that user. I.e., if a particular user's karma is below some value dependent on your filter setting, then every submission from that user automatically starts in the "hidden" state for you.


I ceompletely share your (and hopper's and drprocter's) priorities, but I think you're misreading the sotry, a bit. The 3 stone (that's 42 pounds, for htose of who use the slightly less silly Americn version of the English nomenclature) was just what she gained at first. As far as I can tell, her weight didn't stabilize there. Still, considering the alternative, it seems a very manageable price.

Welcome to GW Bush administration.
I just don't understand Guido's resistance to functional parts in Python. Python is not purely OO, it is multi-paradygm. Why he wants to kill lambda, map, reduce, filter and resists stackless Python is beyond me.
I think the most important point is that this is just another excuse for the Iranian leadership to bring Jews and the Holocaust to the forefront.  If they really wanted to make an equal statement, they would be requesting cartoons about Jesus and Moses.
"Could it be that schools are not good enough because they are 'public'?"

Well, that depends. Thomas Jefferson HS in Fairfax County, VA, is probably better than most or all of the $20/K/year private schools in the area. Ditto the math/science magnet at Montgomery Blair HS in Montgomery County, MD.

As pl suggests, the school districts to a great degree reflect the voting population. There are places where low taxes is the gospel, and low SATs are more tolerable than a 2-8 football season. There are other places where parents camp out overnight to enroll junior in the pre-K French immersion program. I find the latter charmingly neurotic, but the schools are better.
"So now we are playing a game of "whose religion is more depraved"." Unfortunately, that is the game being played when people try to equivocate extremely isolated events of violence against abortion clinics (which all the same I condemn), 500 anthrax threats (scary!, for all we know it was one guy), and historical events from the 1830's (I never suggested it didn't happen, just that it was a historical event).

I could point to the multiple (not one), actual acts (not threats) of violence within the last several days (not from the 1830's) committed in the name of Islam.  

I'm completely baffled by your assertion that scale does not matter.  Let's say there were two societies, A and B, that were roughly the same size. If society A had 10 violent crimes per year and society B had 100,000, then I don't think that most reasonable people would object to saying that society B was the more violent of the two. Scale does matter. 

So please, let's not equivocate, let's condemn all violence.  If there happens to have been all kind of violence perpetrated by Muslims in the last few days, I don't see why we need to try and gloss over, or soften that fact by trying to grasp for incidents when Christians, or Jews, or Hindus, or whatever different religious groups people have been bringing up were violent.  I'll condemn those actions when they happen.  But let's face the present reality with honesty.

"Let go of the hate, man." Who do I hate?  If my response came across as hateful then I sincerely apologize. I am truly trying to keep all my comments as anti-cable-talk-show as I can.  

I would never suggest that "Muslims cannot have the same fears &amp; motivations" as I do, only that they aren't currently reacting how I would.  Do you think I've never been religiously offended?  I have.  Did I react violently?  Not in the least.

I believe that you are sincere in your reluctance to judge the mobs of offended, and sincerely committed, muslims. But I am not afraid to make a value judgement: Their ACTIONS (not their persons) are inferior to the way that western society would have reacted to the same stimuli.  Would there have been an angry reaction in the US if we took out Mohammed's face and put in Christ's? Yes.  Would there have been violence? Maybe.  Would it have remotely approached the level of violence going on now?  Of course not.  If you really believe otherwise, then I guess you and I will have to agree to disagree.  In all sincerity, thank you for the respectful discussion.
I always believe life is fair. You just can't have it all.
i was expecting something along the lines of "30 facts about vin diesel" ;)
The Political Commissar doesn't need to understand science.  He knows the will of the Party, and the Party transcends mere science, comrade.
Except that she didn't say that, but it was caused to a very bad translation of the Danish word 'modspil' - which means something along the lines of 'play against'(as in football).

The bad translation has been widely reported in the Danish press, but maybe because of the low number of journalists in the english-speaking world who understand Danish, there doesn't seem to be many articles mentioning the bad translation: The only one I've found is this: http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared-gen/ap/Europe/Prophet_Drawings_Denmarks_Dismay.html
search for 'opposition to Islam' in the page to see it.
The more cynical side of me though think that journalists(as the submitter, I guess) 'like' the opposition-statement better, i.e. it grabs attention which sells more copies while the correct version wouldn't sell as well.
Definitely not made up. Friend of mine had a very similar story. Psychiatrists do worry very much about weight gain side effects. Apart from not wanting to prescribe someone diabetes and heart disease, the reasoning is along the lines that being overweight will cause long-term stress and can contribute to social isolation, stress often being a major precipitative factor in these kinds of condition.
regarding your citations, forgive me but I cannot connect this mentally with the topic. What has torpor of XVIIIth century worker's mind to do with free movement of labor and goods?

your faq proposes:
&gt;remuneration according to effort and sacrifice.. jobs balanced for quality of life and empowerment plus workers and consumers council democracy.. and participatory cooperative social planning rather than individualist, corporatist, competitive market exchange

but AFAIR all those ideas were thoroughly exercised in Soviet Union not long ago..
Oh, gawd.  It's *easier* to talk about revolutionary consumer electronics that the Soviets didn't invent than it is to talk about revolutionary heart surgeries, genetic engineering techniques, skyscraper-construction techniques, or housepaint that the Soviets didn't invent.

In fact, other than rockets, nukes, military Hardware, and basically-free research like abstract mathematics and theoretical physics, the Sovs weren't good at innovating much at all.
That's what most people expect. Improvement. Better quality of life.
Ugh.

*My censor comment was in response to something stated in the content of the actual article, Jimmy, and not the article.*

I assume you mean "... and not the headline".

Your sentence about censoring *quoted* the headline (not the article), and was immediately followed by a sentence in the same paragraph directly stating that it was an intentionally misleading headline.  And if you now want to claim that that immediately following sentence in the same paragraph was unrelated to the previous one, despite the fact that the previous one quoted the headline and not the article, please further note that that implies that the immediately following sentence in the same paragraph gives absolutely no reason for its claim.

In short, either:

(1) Bull, or

(2) Learn to use paragraphs and to quote what you're talking about instead of what you (now claim you) are not talking about.

*The Joint Chiefs of Staff can express the personal political opinions however they want (as a group with their titles attached or not). It's very common to do so*

The military is generally highly cautious about its officer corps issuing political statements.  Witness the general - Boykin, I believe - who recently got officially reprimanded after saying something to the effect of Jesus is going to kick Allah's ass, for not making it absolutely explicit that he was speaking merely his personal opinion and not in his capacity as a general.

He wasn't officially reprimanded because he spoke his personal political opinion.  He's welcome to speak his personal political opinion.

He wasn't officially reprimanded because he's a hatemongering religious wackjob.  He's welcome to be a hatemongering religious wackjob.  

He was officially reprimanded because he issued a personal political opinion without making it explicitly clear that he was not speaking in his capacity as a general.

And this is for good reason: Whether you pretend it's not a fact or not, political opinions issued by high ranking military officials can have a serious chilling effect.  

Our military is intended to serve the people; many nations are not so lucky in this respect.  Our military is, historically and in general, careful to avoid even the slightest appearance of such, attempting to (rightfully) be officially neutral with respect to American politics.  

Until now.
Does this actually work for anyone yet?
If you're interested in the free market experiment, many cite Polanyi's influential _The Great Transformation._ (Fortunately, if you read it, mises.org also no doubt has a couple rebuttals that you can also consider.) I regrettably haven't gotten around to it yet, but supposedly it covers Europe's closest flirtation with laissez-faire.

Gates Sr./Jr. might actually have a very good guess. As a small example, they can observe what happened to Bell Labs after its parent company stopped being a legal, gov't supported monopoly. Also, the Gateses can observe the pressures that MS Research has to provide medium-term marketable results, even given that MS has a stranglehold on a couple markets. Intel's former head Andy Grove [explained](http://www.forbes.com/2003/10/10/1010grovepinnacor.html) how our semiconductor industries were being destroyed before US protectionism stepped in.

This is not just a liberal billionare anti-"market fundamentalist" belief that the Gateses, Buffetts, and Soroses spout. For example, Buchanan-type conservatives seem to have [various critiques](http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html) that circulate in their magazines, claiming that US-libertarianism is, for example, the "Marxism of the Right."

Radical leftists might prefer [Participatory Economics](http://www.zmag.org/parecon/indexnew.htm), which enumerates 36 possible economic systems (which they classify under 4 broad groups), and offers ideas on how to evaluate each of them. Also Hahnel's _ABCs of the Political Economy_ has an indepth look on the subsystems comprising the contemporary US economy. So for example, he covers the "free rider problem" of markets, which explains why software has so much government intervention involved -- you're put in jail if you copy copyrighted software on your HD, or infringe on a patented idea, or why govt's spend heavily on tech.
True, but even more important than that is the "killer headline"
Unfortunately I never been to US and I don't have much insight in your school system. Are there any competitiveness  among public schools? Do you have vouchers?

It's pretty nice.  Someone pointed it out to me on Usenet, and I was sent off onto a whirlwind tour of very small Lisp interpreters.  I prefer [Embeddable Common Lisp](http://ecls.sourceforge.net/), however.
I agree.  Schools are not good enough because they are public.  Teachers' unions don't help either.  Good luck changing that...

But even if schools were subject to the free market, a bad school would indicate a market failure, and if you wanted to change it, you'd have to change the market artificially.  As an engineer, I'm very biased and think of course we should be proactive.  On every other issue (my health, the environment, etc.) I take a wait-and-see approach (and maybe the bad effects will never come).  So maybe you've uncovered a little of my bias there.

To your second point, while intervening might not be the best approach, I do believe that it can be done effectively.  As I mentioned above, we're just too used to seeing incompetent politicians do it poorly, and we've lost hope that it could ever be done effectively.  If there were a big revolution and every state became an autonomous nation, for instance, you'd see many of them intervening in the market effectively for ten or twenty years (and then they would become corrupt too, because non-corrupt governments are inherently unstable.  Think about it).

The general drift of comments is that these atrocities were somehow unprecendented and out of proportion, and there's no way to analyse it except to say "islamofacists". 

First we have to remember that this kind of violence is not too far from the surface of most societies (&amp; let's not get into homicide rates in the US!). You seem to agree there. Many people delude themselves about their own tribe's wisdom &amp; restraint. Myself included, as it turned out.

I think the Muslim reaction is disproportionate. So the key question is "why?" I think it's being fueled by opportunists to tighten their hold on these people's will. Lord knows they have been told for decades about how evil the West is, and we haven't given them much reason to believe otherwise. There is a lot of pent-up anger "over there". It's not beyond comprehension. We are at a critical point in history.

I was deeply insulted by the original article -- it is a clumsy screed that paints Muslims as irrational, violent ciphers who are out to get us. "Us" being the stalwart members of all other faiths who never (ha!) stoop to violence. It uses textbook call-to-arms rhetoric designed to provoke the reader. Our sacred beliefs are under attack! We must resist this threat! We must... oh. Why, that's *exactly what the imams are saying to the rioting Muslims*. You get it? It's a set-up.

After the initial shock I got a another one -- the number of folk who were taken in by it. Irony-deficient people who have no clue about the world beyond the end of their nose... who apparently believe there are no Muslims living in Europe, or that this somehow justifies general war against Islam.

Thank you too.
I thought this was an interesting article. I suppose I had heard that there are different types of homeless, but it seems much more useful to classify by homeless pattern than affliction. If so many people are only homeless for a day or two, it shows how much good the shelters and soup kitchens are doing. The chronic homeless are the most visible problem, and also the problem not fixed by those shelters or soup kitchens. These are the people that there is no good answer for. You dont just let them die, that doesn't fit into most peoples moral code. If you keep things the way they are they keep costing so much a year. 

This is the first Ive heard of such a solution, and it is an interesting way to think.
It says in the new Privacy Policy that you are free to copy-and-paste it, but the official logs will not reflect any indication of "off the record" chatting.
I'm very wary of this, and mostly agree with TFA.  Whenever a politician calls for increased efforts in Math and Science they are trying to fuck with our educational system.  And God knows it doesn't need any more fucking.  It's been raped and forcibly impregnated plenty enough.

Is this real or satire?

I just disagree with the idea that a word can "technically" be a word -- or not be.  The OED is strictly descriptivist: it tells you what people write and have written.  Someone used the word 'truthiness' in the 1800s.  That doesn't make it more of a word than if no one ever had.  It doesn't make it less of one, either.

The wordiness of a word can be judged by the reactions that English-speaking people have to it -- particularly the English-speaking people you're using it on.  'Truthiness' probably won't stick because people will use it only for jokes.  The ADA voted truthiness the "word of the year" -- not "most likely to succeed", which award went to 'sudoku'.

But it's English, after all.  It's not up to me whether the word sticks around, just whether I use it.
Oh,  I thought you were saying that people would vote for a story just to be attached to a rising one.

Do you think that the "early influencers" trend is good or bad?
About 3 lbs. Certainly much lighter and more effective than the article's turgid and repetitive prose.
The effect is indeed seasonal, but I believe most lighting is still needed in the summer. In net, using incandescents makes your house too hot and your electric bill too high. It warm climates, you pay twice. Once to overheat your house with the incandescents, then again to pump the heat out with the AC.

You're welcome. Yeah, I don't know your situation, but that seems to be common ground between rightists like the Mises Institute, and lefties like Nader. So you might have friends in surprising places.

Lew Rockwell, head honcho of the Mises Institute, actually reached out to the left because he found them more sound than today's rightwing. (On a [business radio show](http://shout.lbo-talk.org/lbo/RadioArchive/2005/05_01_13.mp3).)

Nader advocates a 0% income tax (under $100k; with a top rate of 35% on estates over $10 million). He's against taxing work, because we like work; instead taxing things we dislike such as pollution. He explained this in his excellent [interview with Buchanan](http://www.amconmag.com/2004_06_21/cover.html).

Nader's also explicitly pro- small business, and against subsidies for multinationals, who he sees as just leaving the US for cheap labor under some dictatorship. (Down to "Patronize Small Businesses Week", as well as more substantive policies.) If US-libertarians and Greens can somehow work together for decentralized government, they might go far.
Nope, I started with raw_input and switched to this.

That's because people like this guy don't pay. Isn't that like saying the pricetag at a department store doesn't reflect it's actual cost? Or do I misunderstand your point?

I did read the story. Sure, he says install a firewall, etc., then he goes on to say how hackers can easily bypass personal firewalls. What help is that? He's offering a solution that he  admits doesn't work.
An excellent rebuttal to many of the myths so common (blame Hollywood &amp; the Victorians...).
Yes. When an item at a department store gets stolen, the cost of the goods is counted as the loss, not the price of the goods.  When a drunk doesn't pay a $10,000 medical bill, the cost to the hospital is not $10,000, and the government doesn't reimburse the hospital $10,000. However, there is a real cost, I've yet to find a hospital that actually knows what it is. The problem is concluding, for example, that a $5,000 a year real-costs social program is cheaper than a $25,000 a year medical bill. I don't know if it is, and I don't know if it isn't. I do know that I can't conclude that it is. :-) I still like the article, I just don't want people to think that the savings are that obvious.
Totally awesome stuff.

It's not the same, it just triggered my link.
Good point but what about the non-financial opportunity costs.  The patient who had to sit in the waiting room because there were no beds left or the emotional toll on the nurses who were about to quit.  If someone would have stayed in a bed and paid the full $10,000 but didn't because of the homeless guy was in it then there is a financial cost as well.
[deleted]
This is exactly why socialized medicine doesn't work.  Though German doctors are heading to Britain, just wait.  They'll all be headed over to the US soon enough.  Doctors are one of those little known imports that the US takes up.  The pay is so much better here.  Health care, in my opinion, is also better here.  In Britain, expect to wait a few weeks for an MRI.  And if you have cancer, just pray.
It has some pretty neat capabilities, and it's pretty cool how it uses reader macros to enable a new syntax within Lisp.  A good example of the power of Common Lisp.
The argument against map and filter is that they're always more clear (if slightly longer) as list comprehensions.

    map(foo, l)

looks like any old function, but

    [foo(x) for x in l]

clearly looks like what it does.
Because it contains mismatched HTML tags.
Thanks a ton -- have some karma!
Yeah, hospitals in the US generally are not full, so that is not really the problem. If a hospital had to open an otherwise closed floor because of an excess of this type of patient, that would be a large cost.

I like the emotional toll idea, but the article had a nurse meeting her husband because of a drunk. Err.. perhaps marriage is the emotional toll!

Oh, and the  patient who is insured and is in the next $10,000 a night bed, his insurance company is only going to pay about $3,500. Hospital accounting is a strange world unto itself.
In Canada, there's been discussion about ammending the hate crime laws to protect homosexuals. So far, nothing's gone through, but the effect on freedoms of religion would be absolutely cataclysmic.

I don't know your economics background, but in my intro econ classes (and I suspect occasionally in pop econ mags like The Economist), Adam Smith is frequently invoked when explaining division of labor and globalization; but selectively so. In fact, I had to correct the wikipedia article on the invisible hand, as they carefully elided the part of the sentence which mentions preferring domestic investment.

As for the applicability of 18th century Enlightenment ideas to modern times, you might look at Smith's words predicting that an advanced society will drive towards this crippling division of labor, and note things like assembly lines and Taylorism. David Noble [discusses](http://nooranch.com/synaesmedia/wiki/wiki.cgi?DavidNoble/ForcesOfProduction) this sorta thing interestingly, I think.

While I agree that his attempts at censoring indicate that he clearly is not a fit candidate for his job, I fail to see how him holding a piece of paper or not puts more perspective on this situation. It seems to me that he would have attempted to introduce the same censorship if he would have graduated from uni.
I know quite a few people that never got their uni degrees who are brilliant at what they do, just as I know enough people that did get their degree who are just plain daft.
In light of this, I fail to see how having a degree should be some kind of minimum requirement. Time to mod me down now :)

Edit: it does shed some light on some of the information that we are presented with as being true though, but it hardly amazes me anymore that something like this would surface.
"you worthless, shameless, spammer stop posting your lame stories, or Don't post blogs"

The english language is in constant flux.  The words spam and spammer can take meanings other than "unsolicted commercial email".  

"..and making a few cents from Google ads is a spammer."

Getting a story to the front page of digg drives serious traffic and potentially more than a few cents.  But there are also less tangible gains namely fame, notoriety, a higher standing in "the blogosphere" (which BTW in turn drives more traffic).

Perhaps "shameless self-promoter" is more appropriate if you want to stick to a pure interpretation of the word spam ie. monetary gains.
no not all bloggers - but certainly you :o)

Religion has no use to humanity as a whole or individuals in general. Every day we see this highlighted in the Muslim areas but this applies equally to US Christians who don't believe in global climate change and evolution. My heart bleeds for all the poor women and men under fundamentalist rule.

I'm not proposing that the US not trade with the rest of the world.  What I'm saying is that there are some areas you just don't want to give up on.  The US shouldn't give up on math, science and engineering in favor of marketing and burger flipping.  Math, Science and engineering are essential for longterm economic success in a technological society.  Giving up on them because some group of economists says that they just don't fit in our piece of the 'international division of labor' pie anymore just seems foolish and will likely lead to 3rd world status for the US in a couple of generations. 

However, Bush's plan to reinvigorate math and science education falls flat.  His budget actually cuts student loans and research money preferring instead to keep the Iraq debacle going.

Hedgehog lisp is not common lisp, but a dialect.

It has a very small footprint and therefore can run on very limited hardware. ECL is common lisp, and I think that alone means that its memory requirements are quite hefty (for embedded systems with limited resources...)

HL should be rather easilly portable to any hardware architecture.

HL makes very little assumptions about the underlying operating system, making it relatively easy to port to any OS.

My question is does Iran not recognise the right of self-defence at all, or only to women?
maybe not clearer (when you want to map and filter at the same time), but the closure concept is much more general that list comprehensions
not if you use them all the time in your code.
Maybe. But python cares about readable and easy to read code rather than incorporating general functional programming concepts. Python doesn't support lisp macros? Actually no one cares about it!
That poor girl was dead the moment the those cowards decided to rape her. In Iran it works like this:
1. If you get raped, you get sentenced to death.
2. If you defend yourself, you get sentenced to death.

Now, that's one country just begging for a regime change if you ask me. 

I've always been against the war in Iraq...But I must say, I find it hard to have sympathy with Iran...If one could just take the innocent civilians out of the equation, I'd say bomb the bastards before breakfast tomorrow...
The thing is, we don't have the resources, nor the political capital, given the mess we've made in Iraq, to pursue a military option(*) in Iraq or North Korea, both countries which, it turns out, are a lot more dangerous that Iraq has been for a while.

This story is indeed horrible.  But I don't like the fact that it is obviously abused here as propaganda against the Islam in the context of the caricature issue.

BTW-2:  Don't forget that the US does sentence people to death as well.  And it is a proven fact that at least some of the victims were innocent too.

just to shed some light on the matter, women are allowed to defend themselves against rape and among other dangers in general. In fact, in the time of the Prophet(pbuh) women who chose to accompany armies were welcome to fight. Also I really don't like the idea of the Prophet (pbuh) mainly being described as a woman hater, by people whose education on the subject tends to be quite dodgy.  In fact, even western female writers have described the Prophet(pbuh) as one of the earliest feminists, someone who fought for the rights of women. And islam (true islam that is) does give women many more rights than any other mainstream religion i can think off. How muslims choose to use the religion for their own purposes shouldn't be a platform to abuse the religion itself or the Prophet(pbuh). I'm really not quite sure which brand of islam the Iranian rulers follow.
Lisp macros aren't a general functional programming concept. But it seems mean spirited for python to not just keep the functional stuff (and also it would be nice if they expanded lambda to deal with arbitrary bodies of code instead of just one-liners). My choice of ruby over python for web development was strongly motivated by pythons resistance to a functional style.

Don't make me laugh.  Or puke.  Let me illustrate something for ya, Entropy:

* When *Rolling Stone* magazine puts an image of Kanye West on the cover with a crown of thorns on his head, spoofing the crucifixion of Christ and blaspheming Christianity, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell's minions do not run down to the nearest embassy (or RS offices in SF), fire automatic weapons into it, and burn it to the ground.  Got it?

* Christians (or any other Western religious groups) who do not believe in "global climate change" and "evolution" do not rape innocent teenage girls who are then put to death for defending themselves or *not* defending themselves.  Got it?

Here in America we have this thing called religious liberty.  That means if someone expresses satire concerning your religion you are expected to be tolerant, *and our law upholds this*.  The difference is apparently too subtle for a genius like you to apprehend.  It's a difference of kind, not degree.  

So do me a favour and go peddle that bullshit somewhere else.
Hmm, let's see:

&gt; remuneration according to effort and sacrifice.
Nope. The SU advocated remuneration according to output, all too often in a poorly conceived manner. Remuneration according to need was supposed to wait for the economic, technical and political bases of communism to be established (which was always going to be real soon now).

&gt; jobs balanced for quality of life and empowerment plus workers and consumers council democracy.
Nope. The SU had a hierarchical, managerial approach to production. It strongly believed in top-down, central planning organization. The Soviets had some power to begin with, but not for most of the life of the SU. Workers' and consumers' councils weren't part of the plan, the planning organs of the state were supposed to tune the productive machine.

&gt; participatory cooperative social planning rather than individualist, corporatist, competitive market exchange
Nope. Let's take this one into parts. Participatory? Hardly, as I said, the economy worked in a top-down manner, the workplace was supposed to send signals upwards (production prospects) and receive orders (production amounts) from above, no initiative or participation from the workers. Cooperative? Check. Social? Nope, unless one thinks the high organs of the CPSU were society at large.

There are many things that can be criticized about the SU, and probably about participatory economics too, but they are very much not alike, the criticisms against one will hardly coincide with those against the other.

So your saying that if America was a Christian Theocracy this would happen there too? Have you any evidence you can base that claim on?
Franz's Allegro is the cream of the cream of software development platforms. Supercool just became supercooler.
One more Republican agent self destructs.
&gt; And islam (true islam that is) does give women many more 
&gt; rights than any other mainstream religion i can think off

Exactly how does so called "true Islam" give women many more rights than any other mainstream religion?
The Salem Witch Trials which took place in America by Christian Theocrats.  If a woman was accused of being a witch a simple test was conducted.  She would be thrown in the water.  If she sank (and died) that was proof she was not a witch.  If she floated, she was made of wood, and therefore a witch, and therefore hanged.  This occurred many times and is virtually identical to the story linked herein, and proves that if America was a Christian Theocracy this would happen there too.
Run through the tests and got Fedora (wtf?) and Debian. I prefer Slackware (not even in the proposal list), FreeBSD and Solaris over linux distribution leafy bushes.

Why someone skilled to run such tests anyway if he knows the answers?
Actually, the historical records persist in showing a grand total of 19 victims at Salem (you suggest it happened "many times"...I suppose we'd have to define what "many" constitutes to you).  I'd be a little more careful about going to the historical record if I were you, before you've done a lot more reading.  That's because this is a subject that I know far more about than you do.

Oh, by the way, those trials took place during 1692, a far less enlightened age.  Mullahs are still encouraging the mutilation and stoning of women in 2006.  So sorry, thanks for playing, but again we have apples and oranges.  Sit down.

Middle Eastern women, thousands and thousands of them, have been stoned, hanged, and murdered because of tyrannical Muslim rule.  These are not people who either comprehend or assimilate justice, mercy, or righteousness.

Money is a universal relationship engine, right. But sometimes money replace (and ruin) the relationships between people. Money CAN replace your friendship and social networks, but SHOULD they replace?

SU was theoretically based on all this ideas. I agree, the implementation failed. But I doubt this ideas can be implemented at all. Utopia is utopia.
"Christians (or any other religious groups) who do not believe in "global climate change" and "evolution" do not rape and kill innocent teenage girls."

No, they don't.
They blindly plow ahead with destructive, thoughtless policies which will make the earth uninhabitable for our children. 

They preach abstinence over contraception to control aids and unwanted pregnancy to millions of Americans and Africans despite the overwhelming evidence that this doesn't work. 

They go to war senselessly and cause the deaths of thousands of people, and further destabilize one of the most dangerous regions in the world, and they can do this because they have the unerring conviction that they're right. It's groundless, but that doesn't matter to these delusionals, all that matters is that god told them to do it.

Religion is evil. It's irrational and delusional, and causes needless hate and intolerance.
Nice explanations on what all the awstats reports represent and some good hints and links
"Oh, by the way, those trials took place during 1692, a far less enlightened age."

And you think it's a more enlightened age now purely because of the passage of time? The reason America is more enlightened now is because it's moved away from theocracy (it's sinking back at the moment, but it's still aways from Iran). In the 12th century the muslim world was the height of culture, science and humanity.
Cory's novels are average, and so are his TV reviews.

The "screamingly funny running gag about a fire that's broken out in the basement" will probably give most geeks a (very) brief chuckle.  But this show isnt really all that funny.

"I'm so glad that this show exists. I've waited all my life for a truly geeky comedy, and I think that this is it."

Real geeks appreciate real humor not token "geek comedy".  Frankly its an insult to suggest that geeks may actually find this funny.

I dont think we'll even see the end of this series (I certainly wont).

Synopsis: pathetic.
All you proved is that it happened in America 400 years ago. It doesn't prove it would happen today. And while America was as you claim a theocracy is stopped the Witch Trials and condemned them.
Well it's more enlightened in America don't you think? No more Witch Trials for one thing.
Laws vary from state to state, but in most areas there is essentially no competition between public schools and vouchers are considered unconstitutional. This results in the present situation, where in some areas, relatively little is spent on education and those with money and an interest in their kids future send them to private school. There are some areas with good public schools, but those tend to be the so-called "blue states."

(Bear in mind also, the term 'public school' has the opposite meaning in Britian and America.)
Red herring.  If you still want to equate global warming with stoning and killing teenage girls, go right ahead.  But I'll reserve my right, thank you very much, to consider your bashing of the West regarding the rights and freedoms of women ridiculous.
More proof that Republicans don't actually believe in the free market; no matter how much they say to the contrary.
I'm tired of the claims that religions do nothing but evil, and do no good. (Are you listening Dawkins?) Here's a small list of the great things at least Christianity has achieved:

*The reason America is more enlightened now is because it's moved away from theocracy (it's sinking back at the moment, but it's still aways from Iran).*

There you have it.  With no backup or substantiation, I'm supposed to buy the American theocracy conspiracy theory.  Oh dear, we're about to start stoning women and denying them fair trial any day now!  I'm shocked, I tell you, *shocked*!
Yes.  A rather sound historical case can be made that Christianity actually liberated and increased the freedoms of women and minorities.  It was Christian "religionists" who:

* Lobbied for the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, allowing women to vote
* Pressured the government to end chattel slavery
* Fed, clothed, and built housing for millions of third-world people
* Created many of our greatest inventions and breakthroughs (Newton, Faraday, &amp;c.)

Oh, dear.  Mother Theresa, that evil, evil, religionist!  Hear, hear!
&gt; They go to war senselessly and cause the deaths of thousands

Where exactly are Christians going to war right now? I'm not aware that Christians had their own army.

"Deutsch’s former coworker informed me that in the summer of 2004, when Deutsch was the Opinion Editor for The Battalion, he was offered a position in George W. Bush’s presidential reelection campaign."

This does in no way indicate to me that he lied on his resume about getting a BA in journalism. In fact, it seems more likely that the guy that offered him a position for the reelection campaign would have been in the know about the fact that he was still attending uni as opposed to having graduated from it.

From the article:

"At this point, while I am unaware of whether Deutsch graduated from college at all, it is clear that he did not graduate from A&amp;M, and he may have intentionally misled people to believe that he did."

Possible, maybe even plausible, but speculation at best. Also regarding his position at NASA, as far as I knew, he was appointed by the Bush administration, the same people that hired him earlier.
You don't think we could just jump across to Iran in a few hours notice do you? Iran is right next door to Iraq.
There is a huge correlation between countries (and communities) with appaling rights towards women and countries  that are nearly all muslim.

I would care for one.

&gt; Don't forget that the US does sentence people to death as

&gt; victims were innocent too.

But the US regularly receives cristiscm on reddit for it's death penalty. And the US doesn't execute people who they know are innocent.

Yeah, "modspil" can't really be translated. It's most often used in reference to "debate", as in one shouldn't just accept on face value what another part does/feels/says. Instead, one should provide constructive criticism, be ready to raise one's voice if borders are transgressed, but still take part of a dialog.

In fact "modspil" is probably best translated with "constructive criticism", which isn't at all the same as "opposition"

Army sleeping bags aren't too far away from this concept (ours had arms and a zipper to quickly open the bottom so you could drop straight into a fox hole and start shooting). The problem with these is isolation. You lose an incredibly amount of heat if you can't keep the skin on your inner thighs touching and you can't curl your arms up in fetal position.

That makes a huge difference in the meaning of her statements too. I thought she was dismissing all Muslims and essentially going to war with the religion and all its people. Turns out shes trying to promote debate and cultural exchange. Thats why the last couple sentances didnt make much sense to me.

Thanks for clearing that up.
Saying that killing teenage girls for manslaughter is more important that global warming is your opinion. This opinion should not be forced upon other cultures.
Religion has done and will continue to do good things, but in my opioin it mearly a stepping stone in cultural evoloution. Here in the UK (amoung everyone I know at least) religion has gone, and I consider this a move forwards.
Cancer is caused by heavy metals in our water, virus built 'organic' pesticides on our fruit, Di-Oxines in the air from burning poorly crack fuel and the various other ways corporations make money.


Firstly, what makes a nobel laureate in physics an expert in religion, sociology or history?

Secondly, perhaps he would like to explain how it came about that around 20 million soviets, 10 million europeans, 2 million cambodians, 1 million rwandans (the list goes on)  died at the hands of non-religious governments this century.
Religion, "gone" in the UK?

Hundreds of new mosques get built every year in the UK, with many more coming, last time I checked.  All the data points to Islam growing by leaps and bounds in the UK:

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1892780,00.html

To suggest that Islam is not spreading in the UK is patently ridiculous.
Pfft.  Its pretty obvious that since they didn't have scales back then they used swords for weighing EVERYTHING.
Oh, you so conveniently forgot how christians burned heretics, alive. Burned "witches", alive. How about "in god we trust", and then dropping a bomb on a hospital?
Presumably you are aware that most european christians do believe both in global climate change and evolution.  In fact even the vatican declares ID to be bogus.  Global climate change has nothing to do with christianity at all, it is american economic interests that are driving the debate, not christianity.

Perhaps what you mean is that stupidity has no use to humanity.  But I realise it is far easier to just scapegoat religion.
This just seems like such a great idea. Go Sweden. If only more countries were going in this direction.

It's also funny that US and UK response to the same problem is "More nuclear power!". Well, I say funny, it's actually depressing and scary.
But, uhm, the Big Bang IS only a theory.  There might be a hundred other reasons to hate this guy, but asking that The Big Bang be referred to as a "theory" is a sign of honest science, not censorship.  I think people have forgotten the meaning of the word "censorship."

And as much as the "science" crowd wants to dog this guy for being a political tool, the "science" crowd seems to be creating its own dogma that borders on religious fanaticism, itself.  What an interesting turn of events.
"These are not people who either comprehend or assimilate justice, mercy, or righteousness."
No. There are people who do not administer your brand of justice, mercy or righteousness. If I have read the article correctly, the girl was tried in a court in front of a jury. You may not like their system, but it is their system, not yours. What are you going to do? Invade them and install a government that will administer your justice? Do you think that the population would automaticly swich their morals to yours because you don't like theirs?

*If I have read the article correctly, the girl was tried in a court in front of a jury*

Teenage rape victims are routinely tried in front of a jury with NO legal representation whatsoever.  Young women often are forced to act as their own attorneys:

http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5184

From the above article:

*The teenage victim had no access to a lawyer at any stage and efforts by her family to retain one were to no avail. Atefeh personally defended herself and told the religious judge that he should punish those who force women into adultery, not the victims. She was eventually hanged in public in the northern town of Neka.*

This is justice?
Iceland have similar plans and are persuing them even more aggressively.  But they're lucky in being able to harness an awful lot of geothermal energy.
I don't think python does reject functional stuff - the only changes that have been discussed are rearranging the syntax and sugar for them.  Nothing about lambda affects things like closures etc - def does and always will support this.  The objection to lambda is just that it is ugly and limited compared to a function, not because of any dislike for functional style.

Oddly, one of the reasons I prefer python to ruby is that I prefer pythons syntax for functional style - arguing that map is less 'functionally correct' than list comprehensions is as silly as arguing that ruby is not functional because it lacks first class functions.  In both cases, the underlying concepts are there and _those_ are what matters.

PS. - to contradict srid, I'm a python programmer and I would *love* lisp style macros in python (though I don't think they can really fit in as well as with lisp due to the non sexp syntax)  Then again I'm also glad lambda is staying - its convenient for small adapters and callbacks, even if it is ugly.
Come on people. This story should be true, because, well, I read it on the Internet. Look at the site: http://www.faithfreedom.org/testimonials.htm

Testimonials of who left Islam. Is it not possible that this could be a FUD site against Islam? I don't buy into this story.
All those things are in obvious conflict with "Love thy neighbour" aren't they. It's the people who are the problem here not the teachings.
I agree, they definately are *not* more clear to use except occasionally. Not to mention python's lambda is already very limited.


Good spot. I ment Christianity. It is true that mosques are being built, which is a good thing. I am definitely for religious freedom. I do think however that young muslims, whos ansestors are muslims, are not as orthodox as their ansestors. In my (admittedly limited) experiance children of muslim families in the UK are much less religious than their parents.

Adam Smith's concept of division of labor was more about specialization inside the factory then globalisation. There are also [controversies](http://www.mises.org/story/2012) among economists about the value of his work.
I wouldn't call division of labor crippling by any means. It turns out that A. Smith was overly pessimistic as human assembly lines are more and more a thing of past now. Anyway I don't see any realistic alternative to this horrifying division of labor. If you want to become e.g. a software developer you need other specialized people to make your clothes and food isn't it?

I don't agree that early Muslims were an enlightened group.  Islam destroyed the region's culture, science, and humanity you mention.  Early Muslims lived and died by the sword in order to spread Islam and adopted a new set of values which took the "muslim world" in a new direction.

Most muslims no longer practice aggressive spread of the religion, and, happily, a new culture has developed around their beliefs.  I just wish that Islamic fundamentalists would stop preaching violence.  I truly believe Islam would have been extinguished by now if so many of its followers hadn't become more liberal.  Think about how the world responds whenever a militant group begins conquering neighboring countries (such as Nazi Germany, Imperialistic Japan, Napolean, Ghangis Khan, etc.).

What about it? The US banned it last year.
Whether this site is propaganda or not is beside the point, because the events mentioned in the article have been reported all over the place, and it doesn't change the fact that young women are tried w/o representation, stoned, hanged, and murdered as a matter of course in the Middle East today.
Good to hear that you care for all the other innocent victims as well -- really!  But you surely agree that we see exactily this story of this young girl bubbeling up on reddit and not other stories about the many other victims of studipdity and hate who loose their lives every day.  My suspicion here is that this story is so hot on reddit because it effectively renders the image of muslims as the guys that like to torture the innocent.  This simplification is invalid and conducive only to stoking fear and hate.  As everybody I'm very concerned about the recent events in the middle east.  But I'm as well concerned about many of the reactions observable in the western societies because many people and media here contribute to a extreme emotional escalation which makes it all even worse.  If we consider ourselfs ethically superior we shouldn't be participants of this escalation.
This annoys me. There's a human rights violation in Iran and 90% of the comments here are about how bad Christianity is. What's that got do with anything? Surely we should be discussing the state of Iran's human rights record.
I always thought that countries believed in international division of labour as long as the external work is strategically unimportant.  Europe and the US is happy to import bananas and coffee beans (as long as they haven't been roasted already, of course) in the same way that a company is happy to contract out the cleaning and catering services.

Math/science/engineering are generally considered to be strategically important because they lead to increases in productivity (hence profit and living standards) far in excess of other disciplines and so should not be contracted out to the extent that other industries are.
It's a very good cartoon.  But a sword would have been better than a handgun to illustrate that the pen is mightier than the sword, but then again, maybe that's why the artist didn't use a sword.

Some guys on the Python-dev mailing argue that lambda should simply be renamed to 'expr' - that would clear up some of the ugliness, as the word 'lambda' may mean anything(to non-functional programmers), while 'expr' will more easily be seen as a anonymous synomym for def.

I agree with that view.
But will I be able to sync my ipod to it?
*But I'm as well concerned about many of the reactions observable in the western societies*

I'm glad you're "concerned."  But do please tell me what these "reactions" in the West consist of that you imply are morally equivalent to killing teenage girls.  Thanks.
But, uhm, everything in science IS only a theory. It's understood that all scientific conjectures are theories without having to explicitly state otherwise. Explicitly stating otherwise suggests that theory instead means "guess" which is bogus. It's not scientific honesty, it's purposeful political tomfoolery.

Also, what's this nonsesnse about "people forgetting the meaning of the word "censorship"" and "the "science" crowd seems to be creating its own dogma that borders on religious fanaticism"? You're going to need some evidence to back up a claim that otherwise makes you sound like a moron.

Communism was the state religion in the Soviet Union (and other countries), complete with a Messianic myth ("one of these days [if we all have faith and are good little communists], true communism will come and we will all live in paradise!").

The Nazis were also religious - Hitler spoke of "divine providence" in his speeches. Early on, desperate Germans turned to faith and the occult and all other sorts of unreason to lessen their hardship. The Nazi relationship with Christianity was also revealing - at first, they were not sure whether to embrace it or replace it wholesale, but evidence points to them embracing it.

Will it be as interesting?  The growth and change of the web in general will be an influence as well, of course.  What kinds of things will people be linking to 5 or 10 years from now?

How is Communism a religion? It's a political movement and a philosophy. It has no God, and rejects the supernatural.

define religion

"a strong belief in a supernatural power or powers that control human destiny; "he lost his faith but not his morality" "

Sure. Bush often claims to have been led by God. "God is not dead, nor [does] He sleep; the Wrong shall fail, the Right prevail, with peace on Earth, goodwill to men."

This is the one time I wish I had the ability to mark up something substantially -- the Economist really hits the nail on the head with this one.

One cannot judge whole religions by the (mis)deads of some of their followers. Just as you cannot judge a whole race based on the behaviour of a few.
I don't think so. But I am basing this on a poor article that is obviously propaganda. And my point is we can't simply condem their ethics, but try to understand their ethics fully and then discuss with them why we think our ethics are better.
I only questioned the credibility of the source! The same way I question the link that started this thread, hosted on a site (http://www.faithfreedom.org/) that has on its front page:

[About Faith Freedom International] "Let us eradicate Islam and bring mankind together - the way God intended. Islam is the cancer of humanity."
!!!
What exactly *would* be good enough for you, then?

It sounds to me like you're just being bitchy here.  "I mean, dude, if we never had crime at all in the US we wouldn't have to execute anyone at all!"
Don't forget that the point of this thread is that Islam and Christianity are not equally ultimate on the human rights front.  Just for review:

* Apartheid is not a moral horror equivalent to State hanging of teenage girls attacked by rapists.
* Global warming is not a moral horror equivalent to State hanging of teenage girls attacked by rapists.
* Abu-Ghraib is not a moral horror equivalent to State hanging of teenage girls attacked by rapists.
* Intelligent Design is not a moral horror equivalent to State hanging of teenage girls attacked by rapists.

Are you starting to see a theme here?  I hope so, because you should know that relativistic pandering such as yours won't wash.
I think you are missing a major point. Just look at the names of the two countries:
"The Islamic Republic of Iran"
"United States of America"

The US is not governed that much by the religion as Iran is. And let's face it, religion is not the most rational way of life. Now, in my opinion, if you give the freedom to people of choosing and exercising their religion, it results something apparently better than forcing them into one.

So your comparison between christianity and muslims is exaggerated. It is not that religion is bad, but how they are applied and how much weight they have.

I'm with you.  Part of my fascination with Reddit, is watching how the community votes, and what that means about the community.

There is clearly a politically left bent, but (so far) without much of the fanaticism of many other forums (blogs, etc.).  Most online venues are at least somewhat left, and why is that exactly?  Or am I just sheltered from the political right?

There is the Lisp thing (and now Python, I guess), but I am hoping that Reddit achieves critical mass (and it does appear to be growing quickly – even in the short four weeks since I’ve been looking) and focuses on more mainstream issues (which also appears to be happening).

From the article on oxfam:

"Oxfam International, founded in 1995, is a confederation of 12 independent, not-for-profit, *secular*, community-based aid and development organisations who work with local partners in over 100 countries worldwide to reduce poverty, suffering, and injustice."

(emphasis mine)

from the article on democracy:

"These statements illustrate the idea of natural rights, a *philosophical* concept of the *Enlightment*"

(emphasis mine)

Regarding Newton
from :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_religious_views

"He devoted more time to the study of Scripture than to science" now anyone can see that this was wasteful.

from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies
"Newton believed that Pythagoras must have known about Gravity, and even toyed with the idea of including margin notes attesting it.

Newton, for that reason, did not use his "fluxions," but rather geometric proofs which he thought would have been more accessible to geometers of Pythagoras's era."

So Newton rejected the use of calculus due to his superstitions and religious beliefs. Newton achieved all that he did in spite of the effects of religious belief, not because of them.

And in general, don't confuse the work of religious men and the effects of religion.


Good point, I just caught that myself a minute ago. This article says "into Spanish", but other articles (such as the economist one) actually say "as Spain". It's ambiguous, but either way, it's a startling statistic. A factor of 1000.

Also, from having lived and traveled extensively in Latin America, always looking for good bookstores and hardly finding any, my guess would be that most translation into Spanish occurs in Spain rather than Latin America.
Apart from the fact that the US doesn't have to execute anyone at all, the point made here is that they were executing mentally-handicapped until last year. The fact that such a morally sadistic practise was only just banned is hardly an indicator that "inhumane punishment just wouldn't happen". 

The Iranian story is appalling and similar kinds of things can be found in our own back yards, albeit in different forms. I think they are symptoms of failing legal systems rather than some kind of inherent immorality in Islam. (Of course, by not separating law and religion, you are bound to have one taint the other).

I think that statement is the most dangerous of them all. "It's the people ... not the teachings".  With that one line, people can justify there own religon as good, and any other possible bad outcome by its other followers as their own fault.

Then again, I think that is the point -&gt; "good people to do bad things, it takes religion".

Reddits readership seems to have a bias towards the leftwing and liberalism. Also there seems to be a proatheist leaning as well (I would argue this goes with liberalism, but let's not). 

All of this comes from a simple fact. Reddit readers are smart. We hold the values of smart people. This pushes us leftwards and away from god. Obviously this is a sweeping statement, and is subject to a host of caveats and qualifiers like "for the most part" and "in general", but you get the gyst.

It sounds to me that you might like Lua. I've heard some good things about it: specifically how small the core language itself is yet how easy it is to extend it.
People seem to be surprised by the fact that a Bush apointee is not qualified for his job.  This isn't the first time.  I seem to recall a FEMA director had the same problem failrly recently.

Okay, if this wouldve been more clearly mentioned in the linked article, then it would have made a better point. As it stands though, the original article did not explicitly mention this. There was a link to the NY times, but I refuse to register there, and even if it wouldn't require registration, I still believe that this fact is important enough to have been included in the linked article.

Anyway, thanks for enlightening me :)
Look into pebble-bed reactors. You might be surprised.

Thank you for stating this; someone needed to. It still amazes me how on Reddit a story that has NOTHING to do with Christianity can turn into Christianity-bashing time, time and time again.

I find this to be debatable. Would him having a degree in _journalism_ show that he is qualified to edit a scientific paper?

&gt; It also shows that the person who appointed him is incompetent as well.

Since this relies on the first statement being true, I find it to be debatable as well.

Sorry, I'm having a little trouble following your argument.

You support religious freedom, but you're glad that you preceive Christianity to be drying up in the UK? You're glad to see new Mosques constructed, but only because you believe young Muslims are more likely to reject their parents' faith?

I think you're trying to toe too many lines here, man. If you'd rather see the world areligious, you need to need to have the balls to say so, and not pretend that you support Islam on the side. (Which, given the topic of the story being discussed, is a little bit ironic...)
*The Iranian story is appalling and similar kinds of things can be found in our own back yards, albeit in different forms*

What form were you thinking of?
It's built on XUL/XPCOM, so it'll be interesting to see whether the ability to easily develop user extensions, which is one of Firefox's most popular features, actually makes Songbird a realistic competitor to iTunes.

Vote this story up.  Just a single paper's staff doing what's right is not nearly enough to change America, but it's far more than I expected.  Well done.
I think I said:

"Obviously this is a sweeping statement, and is subject to a host of caveats and qualifiers like "for the most part" and "in general", but you get the gyst."

And as for being smart pushing you leftwards I have no scientific evidence but my experience of the politics of people in academic institutions gives me at least circumstantial evidence.

And I categorical did not say "No possible way a non-atheist could be smart". This is patently false. Pretty much everyone pre 1800, and Stephen Hawking being counterexamples.

So fair enough, attack my position. But don't put words in my mouth.

The Reddit headline (even the Telegraph headline) are somewhat misleading in today's context. 

The author explains he doesn't know if the comments he hears to this effect are representative of the population. These sentiments are also expressed around a euphoric "April 9", which appears to be April 9, 2003, the [date Saddam Hussein was deposed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_9). Optimism about US invasions may have cooled since then.
"Application Error (Rails)"

Now that the screeching hordes have caught the scent, we'll probably be seeing a lot more messages like this one.
except "quality of life" measures usually tend to dilute per-capita income.  I don't care how many 'intangibles' you think are important -- life is better with a $40,000 annual income than with a $20,000 annual income.

And don't start talking about that [overworked American](http://economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5476124) nonsense either -- it's pure egotism.  Americans like to think of themselves as hard-working, and Europeans like to think that their inability to pay for dishwashers and clothes dryers somehow makes their life more idyllic.
What's the difference between a blogger who has a few site ads and CNN.com with more ads generating more revenue.  It should all be content related.  If the content is bad the blogger will not get traffic or ad clicks, so "shameless self promotion" hardly fits the mold of most bloggers.  If a blogger takes the time to write a decent story, and somebody is motivated to click an ad because of interest generated by the story then what the hell is the problem?
Indeed, "per-capita" GDP is a misleading term. I wonder how much of that GDP is concentrated in the wealthiest 1%?

The problem with your theory is that it assumes that Reddit readers can tell that you've submitted your own links before modding them down.  Does that really happen?  I seriously doubt anyone would be bothered to click through to a user's "home" page to determine this.  Based on my own behaviour on Reddit (admittedly not a good metric) I think many users tend to mod down any submitted link that is obviously a blog.  If it's hosted by Blogger, Typepad or even WordPress, forget about gaining Karma.

Why?  Well, there are enough blogs out there now to choke an elephant.  Do we really need another tech, political, or financial blog?  Many of them are just mutual admiration societies and quite incestuous.  Do I need to find out every day who Robert Scoble had dinner with the night before?  (I don't, but if you do you can mod those links up).  I think it's far more interesting when people completely outside of the geek and political world discover blogging:

http://www.englishcut.com/

What we need is a broadening of content and aggregation thereof.  Thankfully, this is starting to happen on Reddit: remember not so long ago (months?) when Reddit was primarly a Lisp/Python/Paul Graham/Guy Kawasaki link farm?  Not very interesting if you work in another realm or have other interests.  Things got better because the user base expanded: good scale.

I disagree about the link on the user page, though.  If you're going to have Karma, it makes sense from a design POV  that it be Reddit-centric and based on the quality of the links you submit than the quality of your (offsite) weblog.  Of course, if you're well-known enough (Paul Graham, Joel Spolsky) you can obviate that by using your real name and probably generate some personality-based Karma.

In the long term, the problems may self-correct. Take an example from history: the collapse of the USSR. The oil wells won't pump out money forever, and when they run dry, the local economy will tank (there isn't much industry other than petroleum - have you ever seen a cheap plastic toy stamped "Made in Saudi Arabia"?), and the power base will go down with it. 

However, this won't happen for many decades, leaving plenty of time for an Arab nation or subgroup to get their hands on a nuclear weapon. I don't think the western world (the US specifically, though I'd expect Israel to have a voice here) will stand for this, and the entire area may end up under what amounts to Colonial rule again.
[deleted]
They made a penny!
One question needs to be answered:  Does the reddit recomendation engine work based on the content of the articles you mod up or down?? Or does it work based on finding other people who like and dislike the same things as you, and recomending more of what they like?
Um...to those who say the big bang is only a theory, you're wrong. The Big Bang is an observed fact. Directly observable phenomena(sp?) indicate there was a central point of origin for all matter in the universe, and that we seem to be drifting away from that point, still carried by our inertia of the explosion.

As to WHY there was a big bang, or WHAT existed beforehand, is only a scientific, peer-review theory. 

And to the people who bring the up the question of the degree, yes, its obvious that at 24, this guy didn't know science from a hole in the ground. It wouldn't have helped him. However, governments set standards for employment. For example, to be a defense contractor and write computer software for the government, you need a degree in a computer-related field (IT Development, Comp. Eng, Comp Sci, etc). Its illegal to hire your newphew because he likes computers and wrote an OS that runs on top of python, if he's only a freshmen.

Will this mean the government might not be able to hire all the best and brightest? Probably. But even if that requirement didn't exist, the best and brightest probably wouldn't want ot work on a government salary either.
Trust me, you'd be hard pressed to find more than 5% of the Iranian population who would welcome a foreign invasion. Once again, here are the top ten reasons why the current collision course is bound to backfire:

It never ceases to amaze me how the world's largest software company makes such a blunder with a product that renders text that is based on well documented standards.

That all those counter-arguments are based on bad data makes it kind of sad they're so well-publicized.

1. No one has ever died from the mishandling of nuclear waste.  Ever.  And our disposal methods aren't hard, either.  The waste is sealed inside a cement cask and is cooled in a swimming pool for 18 months -- during which time the most dangerously radioactive elements decay into stuff that's safer to handle.  Then the casks are placed in a field and... sit there, doing nothing except raising the number of UV and X-ray photons slightly above the already-large number that arrive from the sun or from deep space every second.  Airline pilots &amp; flight crews get about the same amount of radiation exposure as the people who process these casks because they spend a lot of time outside the dense part of the atmosphere and closer to thoes emissions.  The average sailor on a nuclear submarine gets less exposure than either group, because he has an extra 1000 feet of densely-packed H20 molecules between him and the sky.

2. No terrorists have ever even tried to steal nuclear waste -- they'd be better-advised to go after industrial chemicals instead (cyanides, As compounds, etc).  Security could easily be improved by shipping the waste to a central storage center, which hasn't happened because nuclear paranoia has forced us to pursue the embarassment at Yucca Mountain instead.

The decision isn't between "nukes and fossils" and "nukes and renewables."  It's between technologies that work, technologies that *might* work on a large scale, and technologies that won't.  "Nukes and fossils" (and hydro) all work, and renewables don't yet -- show me a gigawatt wind farm that works for six hours a day, and I'll believe you.  Until then, renewables are going to remain something we want, rather than something we need and can use.

That is the type of stories that cheer you up. Nice reading.
As someone who relocated to WV, I'm just glad his comments, when printed in the paper, were for the most part grammatically correct.

You have no idea how hard I cringed when I saw national news papers reprint quotes from family members of the trapped coal miners saying phrase like "ain't done yit" .

Seriously, I know its a red state, but not everyone here wants to be portrayed like we're still "Deliverance".
(Especially those of us who moved here for a tech job).
True, under any system of justice some people punished will be innocent.  There's a big difference between mistakes like that and this situation.  Here the system is functioning perfectly.  "Yes, she was trying to defend herself from rape, so of course she must be punished!"  

This would be almost as bad if she were 'merely' sentenced to prison instead of executed.  Please don't make this into strictly a death-penalty issue.
I think you're missing the point.  There's a difference between lacking the capacity to do something and lacking the desire to do something in specific, reward-oriented situations.  

That said, they'll just put a different tool in there soon enough.

It is indeed racist to assume that every member of some other religious or ethnic group is bad, morally deficient, or whatever negative stereotype you care to mention. But it's *equally* racist to assume that other ethnic groups are universally *good*. It is racist because it supposes that they are too infantile to be autonomous moral agents. It supposes that they are not quite full human beings. If "we" are capable of good or evil or wisdom or stupidity, then so are "they".



Right Now George "Jesus H Christ" W. Bush is leading his marching christian soldiers of operation "Get the rest of the brown ones."

Its starts out in Iran about 9 months from now. When the last of the "dissenting, communie-pinko liberal democrats" get voted out of the house and senate. At least, that's where all the intelligently designed money's saying.

And speaking of senseless Christian war, the crusades "let's take over the holy land because its our holy land too" were pretty senseless.

Just like hanging a 17 year old for manslaughter is senseless.


Maybe you didn't read the quote right. With or WITHOUT IT, you'd have good people doing good things, and EVIL PEOPLE DOING EVIL THINGS.

The part you seem to have trouble reading is in ALL CAPS, for your reading pleasure. 


Not to get too far off topic, but keep in mind that those executions of the mentally retarded in the U.S. were of (as far as I know) criminals who were NOT mentally retarded when they committed the crime for which they were convicted.  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ray_Rector )

So you're going to execute a murderer and that's more or less okay... but then he tries to kill himself, and botches the job, making himself retarded.  And now he should be spared because he is one of the chosen ones... the retards?  That line of thinking makes me sort of queasy.

So I guess I'm some kind of insensitive monster.  Let the down-voting begin!
Unfortunately, we seem to demonstrate our capacity for ignorance, savagery, and hate all the time.  Stories like this just remind me of it.  

I see a lot of discussion and blame being thrown about Christianity vs. Islam, western culture vs. middle eastern culture, etc, but you're going to have a hard time convincing me that there's any culture that hasn't been involved in something pretty despicable in the past, or that they aren't capable of it in the future.

So do I hate you in particular?  No.  But do I hate humanity's seemingly inherent capacity for barbarism?  Absolutely.

It doesn't look great. but it's a preview so maybe it will improve.

In the US, most of us are aware of hateful, exclusionary, or bigoted words/actions by select Christians, Jews, Muslims, etc.

Mutilation is still practiced on babies in the united states. Its called circumsicion. There is no medical justification for it (would you cut your ears off so your head was easier to wash?). 

There are (and I speak from direct experience) undereducated americans in colleges in the midwest that still believe giving birth to a retarded or crippled child is god punishing the parent for Sin. In 2006.

And how civilized do you think we would be in this country if the power and running water went out for longer then 3 days.

Our "enlightment" in our civilization is false. It'd be space age to stone age, in a week. We've just got a better shade of lipstick to go with our chicken.
just to add to this: pebble-bases jars are safe by laws of physics - they turn themselves off before getting out of control.

if the $20k/year (plus heavy taxes) gets you free healthcare and education, for yourself and your family, i'll take it gladly over $40k/year without either of those benefits.

the Nordic welfare states may not manage to give their citizens quite as good socialized healthcare as the wealthiest americans can buy for hard cash, but they **do** give *all* of their citizens health care. americans who aren't stinking filthy rich get to put up with whatever the HMOs feel like granting them - and americans who are just plain poor, or who are already sick with chronic illnesses (and not stinking filthy rich) just don't don't get health care at all. extremely wealthy canadians come south to get medical care in the US... but the vast majority of canadians who *aren't* wealthy still get socialized medicine that's VASTLY better than what their equally non-wealthy peers in the USA can even hope for.

in the USA, if you want your kids to be well educated, you'd better (1) live near a good school, which means in an expensive area, and (2) be willing to pay for private schooling in that good school, which isn't free either. if you're poor in this country, your kids will be raised ignorant, unless you can afford to homeschool them... which you can't, if you're poor in this country. in Sweden, you send your kids to public school and they come back home actually *knowing stuff*. at no extra cost to you.

most of all, in most of Europe and in all of the Nordic welfare states, the cops are *good guys* who actually *help you*. in the USA, unless you're rich, famous, and/or politically connected, it's a toss-up whether they'll help you or hurt you worse. po' folk here are viewed as subhuman scum by the police about as often as not.

oh yeah... the welfare states manage to provide all of the above *and* more annual vacation, and sometimes a shorter workweek too. i'll take the $20k/year if it comes with such benefits, thank you.

(edit: speling fix.)
The McCarthy trials happened a shade over 50 years ago. If you're not old enough to remember, I'm sure your parents are. 

People who did nothing wrong (but failed to denounce their friends, families, and co-workers as communists plotting to destroy america) were blacklisted and could not find work. Others were jailed for up to a year.

So not only did we do witch trials, we did them for 4 years.

Sorry to be the grammar police.
Unfortunately, languages that are extremely flexible at the syntax level encourage code with an extremely steep learning curve to change it. This could apply to someone who's not familiar with the code or even yourself a year from now when you've forgotten half the clever tricks you used.

With python I can be rather sure that I can just pick up anyone's code I need, be able to understand it immediately, and drop it in with my code almost as-is. All this isn't to say that python isn't very flexible, its one of the most powerful languages out there. Its just that the "Have one and only one (right) way to do it" design lets me put my programming ego at ease and get stuff done.

I've used a number of languages over the years, but at last my desire to spend all my time learning every language under the sun has been satisfied. The languages I use have been striped down to just:

 * Bash
 * C/asm
 * java/jython (just for applets)
 * python

Each best suits a problem area. Now I'm refusing to get distracted with the amazingness of every new language feature out there and instead am getting back to developing solutions to problems. This isn't to say that languages such as lisp dont have great appeal. But I will go so far to say that a major factor in the very academic oriented languages (scheme, hascal..) being used to create some of the greatest programs out there is that they simply attract the great minds.

Now if your talking about writing a DSL for circumstances were it provides a clear advantage over existing languages then thats fine. Using metaprogramming to simplify your API, for example, is fine too. But spending all of your time focusing on programming your programming language instead using the language to solve the problem at hand will only get you so far.

So, languages can be tools, they can be toys. Python is among the few that excels at both. Just know, when your criticizing or advocating some language, that when it comes time to get work done you may have to put down the toys;)

Opps. That's my fundie bible. That one might've been made up.
While he may be qualified to hunt down typos and poor grammar, he is not qualified to comment on (and certainly not alter) the content of a scientific paper or report.  The scientific peer-review process is not perfect, but it does have this strength: editors (themselves experts in the field) select referees to review papers based on the scientific knowledge of those referees.  Being a non-expert in earth/space science is precisely what renders him unqualified to review the paper.

That said, I'd also like to echo statements made elsewhere in this discussion: the degree itself is nothing.  It's the learning that counts.  In this case, it doesn't matter because the guy has neither (at least, not *relevant* learning).  Still, let's not confuse expertise with having letters after one's name.  I have a PhD, and one of the things I learned while getting that degree is that many PhDs are morons.  In general, people with so much education are reasonably bright, but don't be fooled into thinking that formal education and intellectual prowess go hand-in-hand.
It's shameless propaganda, authored anonymously. I'll focus on the article's source (iranfocus.com) in my comments, rather than the original article itself, but the original article is simarly tainted.

The rapists don't wear uniforms, silly.
This is a cultural problem. And those really can't be solved by force.

Rape isn't about having sex. Rape is about power. Power and violence. 

With such factors as a growing population of men, shrinking workforce, and a cultural and legal attitude of "women are less then people", they make an obvious target for angry, bitter, unemployed men to abuse and violate for the purposes of power.


&gt; In the US, most of us are aware of hateful, exclusionary, or bigoted words/actions by select Christians, Jews, Muslims, etc.

What do you think many of the statements made in this thread were? Some were hateful, exclusionary, and bigoted against Christians/Muslims.

Do not act like it is a religious problem only. If atheists ever became a majority in America the tune would be no different, only the notes that composed it.

Its just how people are, whether Christian, Muslim, Jew, Wiccan, or atheist.

What it gets down to, though, which people continue to ignore, is if a person says that they belong to a certain religion yet do not truly follow that religion...then they aren't really what they call themself.

Christ taught to love others. If someone who calls themselves a Christian lives a life of hatred and they embrace that hatred, then they aren't truly following Christianity, are they?

This attitude that I continually see which is along the lines of, "I'm not religious because religion is stupid, I'm enlightened and those who follow religion are a fool" is just ridiculous.

There have been some brilliant religious people who never would have done what they did if it were not for their faith in God.

And there are some people who live very simple lives due to their faith of God - and even ignorance. And in some ways there is beauty in a simple life like that. I envy those people.

Sorry for rambling. I'm just sick of statements like this:

&gt; All of this comes from a simple fact. Reddit readers are smart. We hold the values of smart people. This pushes us leftwards and away from god. Obviously this is a sweeping statement, and is subject to a host of caveats and qualifiers like "for the most part" and "in general", but you get the gyst.

This is pretty myopic.  No one is looking at all the products and technological advancements that won't happen because the Swedish government is spending people's money to circumvent the natural path of the market.  Oil dependency will fade as oil increases in price, due to less supply, and you don't need to force people to adapt, they're doing it already.  By forcing a complete switch away from oil, you're destroying a lot of wealth.
&gt; But anyway, how many Ajax Calendar Companies do you think Yahoo! is gonna buy? You don't build a product for one customer. It's just too risky.

Brilliant.
Probably half or more of what I have submitted to reddit has been essays that I myself have written.  I just really started my website a few months ago, and have a reasonably small readership.

I see nothing wrong with posting one's own writings.  If the writings are good, then mod them up.  If they are bad, then mod them down.  But just because the author is trying to get more readers doesn't mean they should be automatically frowned upon.

In fact, I would like to see more of what reddit users have written.  It seems to me that sites like this are largely aggregates of technology news.  Why not have more contributions of original writing from users?
Fewer lines of code is great, but computers can handle a 5 million line program just as easily as a 50 liner. The real questions are, is lisp really **faster** to code in? Is the coding actually **easier** to do? Is the resulting code more **understandable**?

These are what the article should be trying to prove.
&gt; Seriously folks, I defy any of you to tell me with a
&gt; straight face that reddit's readership doesn't have some
&gt; dangerous biases.

Notice that most of the comments in question are part of a
single thread initiated by one comment. Have you seen the
article on homelessness?

http://reddit.com/goto?id=1bp1

I would suggest that, like the homeless problem, police brutality problem, and auto pollution problem discussed in this article, the factors you are referring to have a power-law distribution, not a normal distribution.

Not that I believe being liberal or atheist is a problem, because I am both of those things. But I don't yet see any reason to believe that the majority of redditors are as well. Actually, judging by the links that tend to make it to the "hot" and "top" page, I'd say there is more of a libertarian slant than a liberal slant -- which is pretty much what I'd expect from a geek/hacker-oriented site.
Same here, but my wife's is I think on its 5th replacement, which started failing the day it was turned on, so it is well on its way to being replaced for the 6th time.
Q. If every editor of every publication in the "free world" took the same stand who would be the target of the organised extremists?

A. The very same peoples who were their targets before this whole debacle.  Shame on the cowards, both sides.
that's far more realistic, though, even considering Iceland's geothermal advantage. the Swedes surely mean well, but their plan is basically completely impossible. i predict it'll end up the same way their mid-1980's plan to abolish their nuclear power plants did - fizzling out quietly after a decade of no progress.
Ahem, Arab world or US Republicans?  Just try asking a Republican pharmacist to fill a morning-after pill prescription.  By the way, has Bush and the CIA overthrown the freely elected government of Venezuela yet?  You know, they have oil.  And then there's "evolution"...
Hmm... I dunno if this can be totally given to the shape of government. 

The years leading up to 1980 had unusually high oil prices because of the OPEC shenanigans. 1980 to 1988 saw a disastrous &amp; bloody war against Iran; then the 1990-91 war against the West. Then 12 years of sanctions. Then another invasion. What society could show improvement in GDP during all that? Those things happened because of the decisions of a despot, but I can imagine a solemnly-elected body making the same bad moves.

Uh, check out http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html

Sweden has a per capita income of 28,400.

From http://instapundit.com/archives/003594.php (this is from 2001)

- Median income US: approx $40,000; Sw: $27,000. GDP/capita US: $31,000; Sw: $22,000

- Private consumption US: $20,000; Sw:$11,000 (explained by the fact that school/medicare payed privately in the US)

Assuming the average Swede has 28,000, a Swede spends 11,000 on consumption and aproximately 12,000 on taxes (mid 40% tax rate), leaving 5000 dollars.  Assuming the average American has 40,000, spends 20,000 on consumption, and 14,000 on taxes (30% tax rate), that leaves 6,000.  Not that big of a difference.

Also, in a recent Economist research project, Sweden had the fifth highest quality of life, while America was at 13 (Sweden 7.937, United States 7.615)

Yah, because you know, capitalism has really allowed alternative energy to flourish up to this point.  In your world, we'll end up paying 50 bucks a week to Exxon-Mobile for the rest of our lives.
Not really.

Cancer is caused by errors in copying DNA in our cells.  These errors have many NATURAL causes (as well as  man-made).  A classic example is natural UV radiation causing skin cancer.  Perfectly natural virii can cause the errors also (when they interfere with DNA copying in order to reproduce themselves).

As far as corporations causing us to get sick, that is true.  But, they also do many things that cause mankind to flourish (such as making pesticides that enable greater food production).  Corporations go for the money.  In the long run, that means NOT killing people.
Basically, the article argues that you think of more ideas individually than you do in a group, but that it's a more painful experience.

This, of course, assumes that you're equally likely to actually *try* to brainstorm using the more painful method. Group brainstorming, by making the processing more inviting and less painful, may (or may not) overcome its lower efficiency.

And this article doesn't discuss the effects of small-scale collobaration between two or three people.
Some friends decided to make a film about the forcing everyone behind them to drive the speed limit. Danger ensues.
Amazing computer based animation.
Whenever you have the death penalty, you will occasionally be executing innocent people because no justice system can be perfect. If you choose that trade-off, it means that you are in a very weak position to criticise other countries. If you want to say that there is no way that the Iranian death penalty is comparable with the US, you find yourself in the contorted position of comparing the execution of teenage girls to the execution of the handicapped. The fact that the US might win that particular pissing contest with Iran by a margin is no badge of honour.
Reasoned arguments not the histrionics of other posters (yes wyclif, im looking at you)
What, like Americans didn't kill woman accused of being WITCHES in the 18th century? Just because we're a few centuries removed (and not even that) from the barbary of Christianity doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Point is simple: fuck religion and the ignorance it creates.
I know, how about a "double" logrithmic relation between rankings and article score.

In the negitive direction it could drop very slowly at first and then more quickly as the demotions pile up. This would allow more people to weigh in other than just the eager guys spending all their time demoting in the new section.

In the positive direction the rank could move very quickly at first and then slow, perhapse before becoming linear again around 10.

All the while, only integer scores would be shown. Anyone think this would help?
The only thing I like about it so far is that it plays web radio a lot better than iTunes.  Everything else is still really rough around the edges.
The beauty of the current state of the Internet is that the tried and true ways of corporations don't seem to work all that well.  A couple of guys can start a webapp, tell the world how cool but lame their product is, and ask for help planning new features.  A company like Yahoo doesn't care if a web app like Kiko is lame now.  If it continues to improve and is bought by the big company, it will be rebranded anyway (corporations know ALL about that!).
Somewhat interesting, but mostly seems like a publication just to grab venture capital money for the drug company that patented the findings.  Still, I wish anyone the best of luck at curing diseases.  Sometimes I just get cynical and distrusting of the drug companies.
Religion isn't the literal word -- it's said as 'state religion'.  It is meant as the dominant 'ideology' of the people.
It's corroborated on the amnesty site linked in the story - more details on the circumstances there also.

I think if you are very smart you will be an atheist or at least agnostic, but not a much of a leftist because that is a religion that worships the state over the individual. You would be closer to a libertarian, as much opposed to the Democrats' socialism as to the Republicans' religously imposed moralism.
That's Peter Seibel's "Practical Common Lisp". It is available on line at &lt;http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/&gt;, but do buy a copy and support the author.

the OP portrayed it as religion proper.  I take your point but certainly in this case religion != ideology.
not unless the OP deletes.  Then Im not sure exactly what happens..
lupin, the article in this reddit post has the story you mention as *their* source. Also, the same iranfocus article was posted on reddit a whole month ago: http://reddit.com/info?id=25191.

Although this story is probably (partially) true, I wouldn't believe everything I read on iranfocus. I am yet to find the story about this poor girl somewhere else, *without* iranfocus as source.

Except for the problem that we can't blame McCarthy for hanging and stoning teenage girls by Islam, can we?

AAAHHHHHHH!   This is the same B.S. we heard about the Iraqi people!  It was crap; it was just the smooth, English-speaking exiles like Chalabi (who, by the way, turned out to be deeply in bed with the Iranians who had plenty of reason to hate Saddam and to want to depose the Sunni-dominated regime).  We listened to a tiny, unrepresentative sample - those who left or were thrown out of Iraq.  Big surprise that they are willing to ask Americans and their countrymen to die to get rid of the regime. 

Seriously, if we get fooled by this kind of thing twice in five years, we'll deserve what we get.

"You support religious freedom, but you're glad that you preceive Christianity to be drying up in the UK?"

"You're glad to see new Mosques constructed, but only because you believe young Muslims are more likely to reject their parents' faith?"

This was not implied by what I said. (And I don't see the sense in it...)

I don't really care if the world is areligious or not, but I think that maybe people would be better off if it was. The important point is that people and societies need to develop for themselves. This article is not constructive and therfore simply saying that western/christian morals are superior to islamic morals.
&gt; How is Communism a religion? It's a political movement and a philosophy. It has no God, and rejects the supernatural.

I think it's fair to say that Lenin was portrayed as a super-human with some kind of mystical direct link to a higher power. The higher power was the Communist destiny itself as the Soviet party and state were supposed to be working from a transitional period towards the mythical plane of Communism (it's why you often see Lenin pictured with children pointing - towards the future where Communism had finally been achieved).

When it comes down to it, the language is irrelevent.  

I guess comparing programming languages is perhaps slightly more relevant than comparing say, English to Spanish.  However, if the language is currently being still developed, chances are if feature of language B is getting increasingly popular, they will decide to implement it in language A (or someone will produce a hack that does essentially the same thing).  

The rest is quite literally simple semantics, since the end result can be acheived with any language.  

It's the same argument with Ruby, sure it's cool and may work better in some situations, but are a few cool features worth learning another language.

For me the answer is no.  But, of course, some always answer yes and if they can popularize ANOTHER web-dev language, good for them, have fun with it.  :)
And the article touches on that very fact, saying that Woz himself readily admits that it was a team effort.
Did you look at the graph?
I thought the syntax was pretty terrible. It adds no value to db processing and forces you to write queries in prefix form:
(clsql:select 'employee
\t    :where [and [= [slot-value 'employee 'companyid]
\t\t\t   [slot-value 'company 'companyid]]
\t\t\t[= [slot-value 'company 'name]
\t\t\t   "Widgets Inc."]])

The LINQ at Microsoft definitely helps reduce the language/db gap. Not CLSL.

i've said it before and i'll say it again: if the cartoons in question depicted the pope sodomizing little children, would freedom of speech even be an issue? of course not, no self-respecting newspaper in america would touch them - despite the substantial evidence that the vatican condoned massive child abuse within its ranks. this is a freedom of speech issue for one simple reason - it's acceptable in the west to denigrate islam in any vicious way that springs to mind. for shame. [as a side note: i'm a non-believer in any religion].

This is a bad analogy.  A paper wouldn't print a cartoon of child sodomy, period, whether the Pope was doing it or not. 

However, papers print cartoon critical of religion all the time, and good for them.  How much violence, hate, misunderstanding, and lasting ill-will has been caused by religion here?

/I/ did not introduce the concept of moral equivalence.  Obviously you are running into problems as soon as you start measuring ethics.  This sounds so trivial but nevertheless it doesn't seem to be the consensus.

Besides that, the answer to your question is: "emotional escalation which makes it all even worse".  I leave it up to your imagination to figure out where that could lead to. (Hint: "bomb the bastards")

Finally, my assertion was related to the caricature issue and not to the innocent-girl-case.
you mean like these cartoons? http://www.gaiaguys.net/vic.cartoons.htm


Finally someone spent some time dealing with Iranfocus. Too bad ppl don't recognize this and are demoting this post. Take some time browsing through Iranfocus' articles. It doesn't take long before you realize it's a biased source of "news".
Heh, you seem incredulous. Remember, nowadays we take it for granted that cigarettes CAUSE CANCER. This is however, something certain buisnesspeopple, and their lawyers and lobbyists have denied. This tactic was quite effective, at least initially.

The more I learn about Jobs, the less I like him--if that's actually possible. From stealing from Woz on the first deal they ever did together (which means that Apple was basically founded on theft and deception), to the way he treats his employees, children, and others, to his driving habits, etc.

Steve Jobs isn't pure charisma. He's pure shit.
From their site:

"The same love for God and neighbor that compels us to preach salvation through Jesus Christ, protect the unborn, preserve the family and the sanctity of marriage, and take the whole Gospel to a hurting world, also compels us to recognize that human-induced climate change is a serious Christian issue requiring action now.

"To make clear our views and commitment, as evangelical leaders we have issued the statement Climate Change: An Evangelical Call to Action. We invite you to read and reflect upon it and share your views with us.

"We also encourage you to take action today to address climate change. We believe the problem is serious, but that cost-effective solutions are available that will also create jobs, clean up our environment, make us more efficient, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, thereby enhancing our national security. Working together, and with God's help, we can make a difference."
But no word on Twinkies?
This article is misinformed in so many ways it's not even funny. This is just the sitting government trying to earn brownie points for the election the coming fall.

There is no realistic plan to wean Sweden ftrom dependency on oil. Virtually all cars run on gasoline and car population in Sweden is old and changes slowly. Changing to cars capable on running on anything other than gasoline will take a long time. 

Taxes on gasoline and electricity are very high but that mostly hits consumers. Steel mills for example, buy electricity with much lower taxes and they consume a lot of it. 

The closing of nuclear power plants has caused Sweden to import electricity from Denmark and Germany during the winter and that electricity comes from power plants powered by coal. Not exactly environment firendly eh? And in the rural areas lots of people use boilers fueled by oil to heat their houses during the winter. Of course, the main supply of energy in Sweden comes from water turbines so we've had to dam up many previously beatiful rivers to become so environment friendly.

My kudos to the the people at the governments press office though, a press relase that was basically ignored in Swedish media seems to have been printed verbatim in the Guardian.
Pretty good. Now I know! hehe
Took Europe about 800 years to throw off the shackles of Catholicism.  Let us hope it is more truncated with the Middle East.

I think there is a misunderstood concept of freedom of speech here.  Freedom of speech does NOT mean anyone can say or do what they please when they please.  The New York Times is a business, and it's reporters are employees.

Freedom of speech means they can start their own paper if they want, not that the New York Times is under any obligation to publish those cartoons.

Freedom of speech means that the government or another entity that that has coersive power cannot keep you from expressing.

Just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean you SHOULD.

Jobs is a businessman and Woz was a developer.  Apple relied on Jobs ability to sell things and Woz's ability to innovate, to think that either is worth more or less to Apple's success is a disservice to their history.
no, I believe. So far, since I was born I believe that.

&gt; There is clearly a politically left bent, but (so far) without much of the fanaticism of many other forums (blogs, etc.). Most online venues are at least somewhat left, and why is that exactly? Or am I just sheltered from the political right?

According to a survey conducted by The Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet at George Washington University in 2004, 50% of "Online Political Citizens" were (at that time) Democrats.

The study: http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf
IPDI main site: http://www.ipdi.org

"Online political citizens" are defined as follows by the report:

&gt; We defined Online Political Citizens as people who have within the past two to three months (1) visited the Web site of a candidate or political party, and (2) taken part in at least two of the following online political activities:
&gt; * made a contribution to a candidate or political organization online,
&gt; * received political e-mail,
&gt; * forwarded or sent political e-mail,
&gt; * visited or posted comments on a political Web log,
&gt; * participated in a political chat room, or
&gt; * visited a news Web site for news about politics and campaigns.

All that said, there are many conservative blogs and other conservative or Republican venues online:

I saw Joel speak in person for the first time (I was at last night's NYC Tech Meetup).

Even though I've enjoyed some of his past articles, I was less than impressed with his presentation.

He started well, with an insightful satire of web 1.0 vs 2.0, but he went too far in mocking the two speakers who preceeded him (they both demo'ed job search sites and he said something sarcastic about lemmings in tech all doing the same thing these days -- job sites).

He takes that same mocking tone too far in his "Ajax Calendars" article also.

He assumes, perhaps incorrectly, that all these startups are just hoping for a buyout by Yahoo -- but I can't help but wonder whether or not that his sarcasm is tinged by the realization that such a scenario does not exist for him.

In other words, how likely is it that Yahoo/Google/MS et. al. would want to buy Fog Creek and make Joel truly wealthy?

It's unlikely, and I think he knows that, which causes him to come across like a curmudgeon.


I admire Jobs, because of his charisma and willpower, but i don't like him personally. Woz is just the nice guy, who happens to be very rich.
How about a little semi-transparent overlay of "what day/time is it in New Zealand" that sits on top of your regular calendar when your appointments have you overseas?
Does this article even work for other people?  It must because of all the comments, but on my Safari, at least, all I get are ads.  No article text.  Weird.
If you insist on respecting the rules (find an algorithm running in less than one minute on an average computer), then this becomes interesting.

We've all seen The Matrix.  Obviously the solution is full-body acupuncture, right?
So you hope it takes less than 800 years for the Arab world to throw off the shackles of Catholicism?


I think it is reasonable to say the following: if some mystical force modified the human race to cause us not to be religious at all, the changes that force would have to make in order to remove religion would be a net benefit.

Clearly just forcing people not to be religious would not have any positive effect; that's why I phrase my statement in that way.
Actually, he has a point.  The link is not about Catholicism, no matter how many times you try to re-direct it.  It's about radical Islam.  Stay on topic.

Nope.  Won't work.  This thread is about Islam, not BushMcChimpyHitler.  Bzzt.  Thanks for playing.
Good read.
One out of two Arab women can neither read nor write.  No wonder their entire culture is so retrograde and freedom so suppressed.
Oh to get in this guy's head. Very neat. Nice article, too.
Also "Elvish."  But, really, this article is eerily accurate.  And written by a woman!  I thought I was alone.
I don't think I suggested that atheists were incapable of bigotry, etc.  You're right, it is a *human* problem.  I was mostly trying to highlight that I (personally) am unfamiliar with similar anecdotes involving Buddhists.  Does your knee hurt when you jerk it like that?

Additionally, I would prefer you not lump all atheists together just as you (probably) prefer not to be lumped with all theists.  Some (myself included) are agnostic atheists.  Being agnostic means recognizing that the whole issue is not decidable (in essence).  In my opinion, belief and non-belief are on equal footing (or... lack of footing) in the grandest scheme.  However, I must admit that occasional(?) verifiably-false claims by religious folks (e.g., the earth is only 6000 years old), cause me to snicker a little (forgive me... won't you?) and feel that the error must be rooted in a deeper inability to see the true nature of things.

I appreciate your comment that acting like a Christian is central to *being* a Christian (though I believe there are alternative views within Christian circles).  I dislike hypocrisy, certainly, but just because you'd like to disown the members of your group that do evil doesn't mean that those acts were not performed in the name of a God/doctrine/leader/scripture with whom your group is associated.

Finally, I agree that the last passage you quote is arrogant and is (I think) also silly.  That guy needs to get a bunch of "smart people" in a room and ask them to write out a coherent statement of their collective values.  When the dust settles, I'd like to know whether he still believes his own words.
[deleted]
i take your point about the analogy, but i think you're using it to miss the point. the cartoons are hate-speech, published with the intention of demonizing muslims in general and arabs in particular. what's worse - both are a soft target in europe and america. this kind of "free speech" is rarely used against those who can make the speaker suffer for it - hence a western media that rarely questions its masters.

I don't think Joel ever planned to have Fog Creek bought by Yahoo, or by anyone else. There may be other things that are making him curmudgeonly (heck, the stresses of running one's own company are an excellent motivator for that), but I doubt that particular explanation.

"Freedom of speech means they can start their own paper if they want, not that the New York Times is under any obligation to publish those cartoons."

I don't think the staff who quit their job would disagree with you. (Nitpick: the paper in question is NY Press and not the NY Times.)

The article pretty clearly states that they believed it would be "nakedly hypocritical" of them to back down from publishing the cartoons due to publisher pressure after they had criticized other papers for similar behavior.

It's hard to disagree with that line of reasoning, regardless of your stance on the cartoons.
BTW WTF does A&amp;M stand for?
I think there is some weird confusion going on with this. Papers should have no problem running the offensive cartoons in an article about the offensive cartoons (especially if they are talking about the violence)

However, I do NOT blame papers for not just publishing them outright. They ARE offensive to a large group of people, and no it doesn't take away their right to publish them, but papers don't regularly print offensive cartoons in general.

I think the author screwed his own point over by saying
&gt;not especially offensive

because the issue here isn't how offensive they are, its about freedom of speech.

I support papers running the cartoons when discussing the issue, just as I would support them showing other hateful speech in discussions about hateful speech. I don't think it s bad that they don't run them on their own, thats like condemning a paper for not running a pro-KKK cartoon or jesus pissing on a cross. It would be their choice not to offend a large amount of people.
At the same time, they made a newsworthy protest. You do have to pick your battles, they picked this one.
This problem will likely increase as fewer and fewer good, "respectable-looking" domain names are taken.  allthingsfinancialblog.com may look kinda spammy, but so does ffzywokdds.com/financial/ , or whatever.
I disagree with your anti-tech blog sentiment. I think that this is exactly the place where good blogs should be found. People may post one good thing and 10 bad ones, but we all want to read that one good thing right? So when somebody posts their blog I think it would be better judged on content not status.

I like timg's idea of slow downmodding at first so that more people will judge on content rather then name. The whole point of content aggregation is not to get things from credible sources, but make good things credible.
its funny cause its true. i'm not a lisper but i don't mind them hanging around. they're generally nice about the manner in which they describe how everything that will ever be needed for computers was already invented in the fifties. not like some other language zealots...

I didn't say anything against tech blogs.  I syndicate an awful lot of them, and enjoy the ones I read now.  I only suggested that there are too many of them, and I feel maxed out on them when I read them in my RSS reader.

I'm only guessing as to why people mod down when they see a blog URL.  It isn't a deal-breaker for me.  A lot of the best links on Reddit are blog entries.

I think the problem might be splogs and people gaming AdSense as well as SEO.  It's not accurate to call blog linking on Reddit "spam"...the essence of spam is that it is unsolicited in nature.  If you don't want to read blogs on Reddit, it's not hard to avoid them.

Ultimately, I agree with you that something needs to be done about the "New" page.  I'm not sure yet what would make this better.

To believe this implies belief that these countries have abnormally large numbers of evil people in them, in particular far more evil people than other countries and far more evil people than in other ages.  I personally don't believe this for one minute.  It seems far more reasonable to me that these people were just caught up with the current dogma of the day and wound up by charismatic people scapegoating certain groups in society.  It doesn't require religion (in the strict sense of belief in God) to do this, in fact nazism was (afaik) grounded in social darwinism.

If you read some of the literature to do with the holocaust you may come to realise that it doesn't require religion for otherwise good people to do evil things.
Don't blame capitalism for this.  The US government, for example, has prevented the creation of new oil refineries, as well as distorting (increasing) incentives to drive by creating public roads that people don't pay for directly.  Nuclear power is virtually regulated out of existence because the government gives power to environmental lobbyists.  Government granted power monopolies abound in this country strangling competition.  We have an insanely messed-up energy market because of our government's actions, and as usual, people blame the free market.

In your world, we'll all worship at the Church of the State, praying for the government to solve the problems it created last week.  The state does not benefit from solving problems, it benefits from pretending that it could solve them if only we give it more power.  When was the last time you heard of the government actually creating a lasting solution to a problem?  Crime?  Education?  Poverty?

This is why mobocracy doesn't work.  We are short sighted creatures.  When we vote, we look only at immediate consequences, and not the hidden results of our policies.

I see, communism is a religion.  And i suppose if it had ended up successful (without the slaughter of millions) it would have been called 'social science' and democracy/capitalism/whatever would have been called a state religion and used as evidence that religion is evil.

It's easy to 'prove' that religion is evil.  You wait 50 years, look at all the big ideas that happened over that time period, class all the ones with disastrous consequences as having come from religion (perhaps by prefixing it with 'state'), and the ones that turn out quite well as being caused by the underlying goodness of mankind.

I second that comment. Canada not only has a thriving nuclear power sector, they have a thriving nuclear reactor export industry. Japan gets a good chunk of its electricity from nukes, despite their "allergy" to nuclear weapons.
Personally, "more nuclear power" is more reassuring than "more coal", or, has been more typical, total silence on the subject.

I think this is dangerous. BUT it saves a lot of gas. I seem to recall reading that cars were optimised to run at the 55 - 65 MPH.

I wonder if the cars being packed together would draft off each-other contributing to the fuel effeciency?
I don't know whether executing mentally disabled people is inhumane, but I don't think it's the moral abomination you're making it out to be.  Punishing a young girl for exercising her (UN-recognized) natural right to self-defense is so completely indefensible that it makes us wonder whether the article is propaganda.  Executing a man with a 70 IQ for raping a woman and bashing her head in with a brick raises fewer hackles.
Well, strictly speaking they *were* breaking the law. At least in most states, it is illegal to use the left lane except when actively passing another vehicle. 

But I agree, it's intriguing. There aren't many laws that are as commonly flouted as speed limits, with the possible exception of prohibition-era alcohol consumption. 

My guess would be that it has to do with "a small group of committed citizens" prohibiting something that was previously widely enjoyed and considered mostly harmless. 

Aside from the lawlessness, I think the anger arises because the way they were driving is basically bad manners, and that sort of breaching of the social contract pretty much by definition makes people angry.
&gt;life is better with a $40,000 annual income than with a $20,000 annual income.

How did you find the language issue living in Northern Europe? Did you bother to learn the local langauge or was it enough to rely on everybody there knowing english?
What do you think will be done with speed limits in the future (say, 100 years from now)? Assume any reasonable technology achievements.

Here's what i think: Only the fastest 5% of drivers on a given stretch of road would be eligible to get a speeding ticket. So if everyone else were doing 70, you could do 70 and not fear getting a ticket. But if you sped up to 78, a light might go on in your car to notify you that you were now in the top 5% of speeders at that moment and could qualify for a ticket unless you slowed down.
Fuel consumption rises more or less with the square of speed once you get above 35 mph. So you roughly double your fuel consumption if you drive 78 instead of 55.  

And as a rule of thumb you can't safely follow another vehicle closely enough to save fuel, whiz-bang electronics or a cooperating leader notwithstanding. NASCAR drivers have the benefit of a closed course, and they still crash a lot.

The arab world is in such a state because of colonialism and not because of Islam. The Islamic fundamentalists have so much power in the Muslim countries because the colonialists helped them to get into power, in order to weaken the Middle eastern countries and colonise them. 

Islam is not a violent religion or some that mistreat women. Fundamentalists do. Islam and true Muslims don't. 

Furthermore, we own the Muslims a lot in terms of scientific advances and knowledge in general. They are the ones who collected and translated most of the philosopher's works from Greece, which as you probably know is the basis of our moral - Democracy is greek. They also made huge advancements in sciense, medicine and mathematics such as Algebra, surgery, anatomy and astronomy. In fact, they invented algebra and algebra in itself is an Arabic word.

I suggest you do a bit of historic research before you post. If you take all your information from the TV or newspapers, you don't really have a critic mind. In order to have an opinion on some topic we need to compare different sources of information before we build an opinion in our mind.

&gt; If you want to say that there is no way that the Iranian death penalty is comparable with the US, you find yourself in the contorted position of comparing the execution of teenage girls to the execution of the handicapped

The Iranian court took a deliberate and dehumanizing position -- that girls must be punished for defending themselves against rapists -- in line with a bigoted worldview.  I imagine they'd do it again in the same circumstances.

Executing the handicapped may not *sound* very nice, but you can phrase it in such a way that most people would approve: "executing a someone guilty of a heinous crime who just happens to be handicapped."  Either way, I don't think it's the fact that the criminal is handicapped that you're objecting to -- it's the idea that handicapped people are more likely to be innocent (hence, wrongfully convicted).  (pointed question: what is the implication for other protected classes like women or blacks?)

If that is your argument, it's misguided.  We might execute people wrongfully in America, but we never try to.  When it happens, people are appalled.  And it's ludicrous to suggest that Americans who support the execution of disabled people also support the execution of *disabled innocents*.  Now that the Supreme Court has handed down its decision, mentally handicapped convicts will be imprisoned instead of executed, and a few will still turn out to be innocent, in your formulation ("no justice system can be perfect").

American convicts can still hope for exculpation, or maybe a new trial.  The Iranian system presumes women are guilty and allows now reprieve.

Great article, and illustrates why their going nuts over a cartoon.
Any system is going to made up of imperfect people who make mistakes.  Doesn't it count for anything that your link goes to a *protest* site?  That the fundamental disagreement is over *how much* we have to do to protect the rights of defendants?

Does the US justice system have to be perfect before it can be compared favorably to Iran's?
Helter, the point of the article is not to attack Islam.  The point of the article was to illustrate how islamic fundamentalism, combined with weak governance has seriously hurt Arabs.

Truth be told, they need freedom of religion first and foremost.
This is true, the chip technology was not invented by Woz, he picked the Motorola 68000 or something like that as the CPU and put together a bunch of other chips to control the video display and the disk drive. I don't know the technical specs, but you make it sound like he inserted a graphics card into a motherboard and called it a computer.

Sure he didn't build any of his own chips but he put them together, and built the OS to run it. You are downplaying the achievement that that was.

yes computers existed, but Woz built the personal computer. Other people were saying no one would ever need or want a computer in their home, Woz and Jobs put one in their homes. 

as for Jobs, yes he is a critical part of it. Woz wasn't going to sell a lot of computers no matter how technically powerful they were. But in terms of persons Jobs is a jerk but a genius in his own right. Woz is really nice and a genius in his own right.

Ok, so we can discharge the new batteries really quickly, and they have a long lifetime, but as far as I can tell from the article, we don't get much (if any) advantage over conventional batteries as far as charge to weight ratios. So don't expect these to make your laptop lighter or go longer without a charge. Does anyone know more about these characteristics of the new batteries?
1. Some scholars have suggested that the 'visions' people in Salem were having that led to the witch trials were do to powerful hallucinogens secreted by ergot fungus growing on the rye the villagers were growing.

2. Don't you mean "fuck religion and the intolerance it creates" ?
Why is Africa also in such a state? Also because they don't have freedom of religion? Colonialism has destroyed all these countries in Africa and the Middle East. When people don't have nothing to eat it is unlikely they will have time or energy to think. We looted their countries and now we blame on them. They are the ones who should be blaming on us. You can't be so superficial to blame their governments, most of them are appointed and supported by the US, included old Sadam.

Helter, I don't read the article as negatively or as biased. It does, in fact, point out that the Arab world during a long period of the middle ages was at the forefront of culture and science in the world. (The numerals we use today all over the world are a testament to that). It's more on a historical scale, like saying "Rome used to be the center of the world, and during the Middle Ages fell into poverty and obscurity until the Renaissance."

It also points to the dysfunctional colonial rule(rs). However, the focus of the article is not so much on the historical development and reasons, but rather on the current status, and the importance and urgency for improvement in important sectors of society.

The original study was conducted by a group of pan-Arab scientist for the UN, so while the Economist has given it its treatment, at least some of the numbers stand as undeniable facts, irrespective of cultural biases or prejudices.

I am very sympathetic to the fact that universally no human being or group of human beings enjoys being ridiculed and humiliated, but I think that it is really important that people in the Arab world start building a collective feeling of self-worth and pride that is based in something other than a dogmatic and, frankly, medieval interpretation of religion.

This sort of change can only happen if moderate voices from within the Arab world can gain more influence. I am hoping that Muslims in the West can help "translate" and mediate between two cultures that need to and can get along.

European integration policy has serious shortcomings in many regards, and treating those Muslims who actually know both cultures and mindsets as second-class citizens strikes me as a) not very nice, and b) a really bad policy for long-term stability and peace.
Hopefully people realise this is just a joke!
&gt;the cartoons are hate-speech

I think this is the crux of everybody's disagreement.  The source and intent  changes the meaning a lot. If these were published in a neo-nazi magazine, then they were obviously meant to incite hatred.  If they were published in a secular humanist magazine, they would merely be critical.

And getting back on topic, if they were republished in a newspaper while discussing the controversy, they're merely informative.  Not even at the level of critical.  Certainly not close to hateful.  The public deserves to know what's being discussed, and what's at stake.  

The cartoons have risen to the level of an important international event, so people should know what's going on.  I won't debate your assertion of the cartoons being hateful, because I don't know what to make of them myself, and I can sort of see both sides.  But I think we can both agree that it doesn't matter in this case.  Even *Mein Kampf* should be available to be viewed, no?
Actually, allthingsfinancialblog.com looks spammier to me than randomurl34934934.com, but maybe that's because I'm attuned to the latest trends in Google spam.

Regarding the article, I wound't expect anything but.
there's almost no content here !
&gt; The Iranian court took a deliberate and dehumanizing position -- that girls must be punished for defending themselves against rapists -- in line with a bigoted worldview.

No they didn't, not in the articles I read. The Iranian court did not find the girl guilty of defending herself as you say, but of murder and they didn't find her mitigating defence convincing. Sounds like they were wrong; we also have had many miscarriages of justice in the West (and that's usually without having the courts run by old men on some kind of religious principles).

&gt; you can phrase it in such a way that most people would approve: "executing a someone guilty of a heinous crime who just happens to be handicapped."

But you are assuming that the handicapped are guilty - you can't know this and there are plenty of examples of convictions later found to be unsafe. (I am not saying that they are likely to be innocent because they are handicapped as you suggest - I'm not aware of any causal link or statistical correlation between disability and crime). 

&gt; And it's ludicrous to suggest that Americans who support the execution of disabled people also support the execution of disabled innocents.

Well either they do and consider it a price worth paying, or they are under the false impression that the justice system is infallible.

I didn't oppose so much the article as the comments that the people posted in relation to it. I think the article could be written in a fairer way, or at least clearer, but anyway it didn't disturb me so much. However many in this forum seem to equate Islam and Fundamentalist, and that's like if we equate Germans and Nazis, or Jews and Zionists.



The crusades were also, what, 600? 700 years ago?

It doesn't diminish their position as an embarassing black mark in the history of the Church, but the lack of *recent* evidence suggests that perhaps mainstream Christianity has changed since then, unlike those discussed in the story.

Or perhaps the Crusades serve primarily as a caution: A caution about what happens when religion and politics get too mixed up with one another...
If you'll forgive me borrowing an analogy I've heard elsewhere, appending "theory" after every instance of "Big Bang" is like always putting "ancient set of myths" after "Christianity."  

Note that a common definition of "myth" is not "false story", but rather a *traditional* story that has been passed down through generations, which Christianity certainly is. However, to the general population, myth means falsehood, just as theory means weakly supported hypothesis.

Words and meanings are highly contextual, and Deutsch's meddling was clearly meant to spread undeserved uncertainty and doubt by wedging in between the two meanings of theory.  That's sneaky and deceitful, much like like lying on your resume.

Science isn't creating a dogma, it's *founded* on one: observation and reasoning trump ideology and preconceived notions.  That dogma has worked out pretty well so far!  For some reason, political hacks don't seem to like it though...

I don't get it, why does EVERYTHING have to be the fault of the United States?

I mean, isn't it possible to consider that somebody somewhere actually did something bad and it was their fault instead of the United States?

At what point do people actually have to take responsibility for themselves?

And as for you, if you're from the United States, why do you have such guilt? Just because you happened to be born richer than most people, you have to be guilty? Why do you have to think that everybody else in the world is innocent and that all evil that they do is somehow the fault of your country?

I see this attitude all the time. I just don't understand it.
What makes an article hot is that reddit users vote for it, not it's age. That's the point of reddit you know.
You know, at some point people and countries actually have to take responsibility for themselves.

(Excuse me if that was a rhetorical question; ignore this post if you were. I've studied this phenomenon a bit.)

I've noticed that dissidents get this question a lot, and have tried to explain it. Let's take Chomsky as an example, as he's among the most famous dissidents, maybe near as well-known as Michael Moore. When asked why he keeps blaming America, he explains that as a citizen in an unusually free nation where its citizens have fought their leaders for the rights to free speech, he feels a moral responsibility to speak out when he perceives the press hasn't done its job, and when the nation's leadership is committing horrendous acts.

In a dictatorship, he'd be largely absolved of blame, in his mind. However, US citizens are somewhere between a dictatorship and actual democracy. Therefore according to his moral calculus, he shoulders some portion of the blame for the US's actions.

Another part of his calculus is that as a "fellow traveller" with anarchists, he believes that authority has the responsibility to regularly justify itself. So in his worldview, the burden of proof is on those powerful enough to invade multiple nations, and large-scale international "violence" is among the most serious burden of proofs one can imagine.

Another thing he claims is that we like to talk about the bad things others do. However, he thinks we don't like looking in the mirror and focussing a fraction of that scrutiny on ourselves. So he claims that indeed Hussein and the Soviets were terrible (there were apparently even bans on linguistics in the Soviet Union because they didn't like him), but our main responsibility is to take care of what we can actually affect. Just as we expect Arabs to fix their own problems, he thinks we should do the same.

Now, that's just one guy who many claim is an apologist for non-Americans. Other dissidents have different motivations, but we have to start somewhere, so we can actually scrutinize dissident thinking for flaws.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the US colonized any Arab country. I think Britian controled places like Egypt and Palistine.
So what MrRage? US and Britain are historically the same.There is no such a thing as Americans. Well there was but we killed them and their culture. 
And by the way, the US is colonosing the Middle East by appointing corrupted rulers for these countries who isntead of looking after their country and people will look after US interests.

You're missing the point. The Koran says depicting the prophet or allah in images is idolatry and blasphemy. Doesn't matter who does it. And that's the primary reason for the outrage in these cartoons as well - the fact that the cartoons are unfavorable depictions is secondary.

&gt;...arguing that ruby is not functional because it lacks first class functions.

I keep seeing the claim "Ruby lacks first class functions". I'm not sure where it came from, but it seems pretty widespread. Maybe Ruby lacked first class functions a long time ago? Anyway, it's pretty easy to demonstrate that Ruby does have first class functions:

    def accgen (n)
      lambda {|i| n += i }
    end

    foo = accgen(5)
    foo.call(5) # returns 10
    foo.call(5) # returns 15

accgen function borrowed from http://www.paulgraham.com/accgen.html
This just goes to show how religion is systematically abused by those in power to manipulate the masses. Guess Marx said it best when he said religion is the opium for the masses.
What's really dangerous is differential speed. If everyone else is doing 80, and you're doing 70, **you** are creating a hazard, regardless of the posted limit, or the fact that higher speeds are inherently more dangerous. I think what's really needed is maximum and minimum speeds that are fairly close; a minimum of 40 with a maximum of 70 or 75 is absurd. Anybody actually attempting to drive a significant distance on an Interstate at less than 60 mph[0] is asking for trouble.

I once saw a situation in which parents called the police because they claimed that a 7 year old boy had groped a 14 year old girl. As it turns out, they were wrestling along with several other children and he *had* touched her between the legs. He (unsurprisingly) didn't understand what he had done wrong, and the girl wasn't really upset. The adults blew the situation way out of proportion until the police came and straightened them out.

Maybe they were trying to describe [Na&amp;iuml;ve Bayes Classifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayesian_classification), but for some reason everyone seems to dork the simple math.

Overall, programmers tend to write lines of code at about the same rate regardless of what language they're using, so a language that requires less code to accomplish the same task will tend to be more productive. They also tend to write bugs at about the same rate (per line of code), so a denser language is less error-prone.

As for understandability, well, Lisp isn't Python in that it **is** possible to write obfuscated Lisp, but well-written Lisp is very easy for someone who knows the language to read. The famous quote

I think there's a subtle but real difference.
Then you are mistaken. Why do we know so much about Ancient Greece? Because the 9th century Muslims translated their books. Socrates is regarded as the father of Western thought, his pupil was Plato who in turn taught Aristotle. Pretty much everything we know about their teachings comes from Arabic translations, including every single one of Plato's 45 books. The Arabs not only copied them, but also added extensive commentaries.

The Muslims quite literally preserved our culture for us during the dark ages in Europe.

On the other hand, even the taxi drivers who didn't speak a single english word were making fun of my beard suggesting me to shave: beards are considered as a sign of being pro-regime.

Current religions are obsolete. They do not cater and scale up to the present day requirements and expectations.
Though I agree with you(rofl) in principle, the fact that the cartoons were shown in a Egyptian newspaper without anyone really giving a damn, tells us that depicting Muhammed really isn't a big deal - nor the fact that they were 'insulting'. Nobody gave a damn, untill Saudi Arabia needed to divert attention from collapsing pilgrimage hotels, that is.

Seriously, I think this really shows hypocracy at its finest among muslims who've been telling people how evil it is to depict Muhammed and that it is an unthinkable thing to do in the Muslim world. And I do hope it'll reach longer than some blogger's homepage(no disrespect to bloggers). I suspect this could rock the Egyptian government badly, considering the noise they've made over the cartoon affair.

Silly assumptions have been made here:

1: To test their theory, they recruited hundreds of students and asked them, either on their own, or in differently sized groups, to think of as many ways as possible to boost tourism to Utrecht. Afterwards the students in groups reported feeling more satisfied with their performance, and feeling that they had experienced fewer failures to come up with new ideas, than did the students who’d worked alone.

Alternatively the satisfaction of the guys in groups was justified you never mentioned why the paragraph you quote even matters.


2: In a second study, Nijstad’s team found further support for their theory by showing that the illusion of group productivity could be undermined if different members of a group had to think of ideas for different projects. In this case, the students’ satisfaction with their performance and their sense of how much they had failed to think of new ideas, resembled the experience of students who worked alone.

Again first order critical analysis failure, the paragraph you quote has no real contextual meaning. It says nothing useful: "People working in isolation, whether in proximity or not perform similarly." Useful knowledge.
I assume by trollish you mean inflammatory.  Good point, thanks.  I'll back off now.

Seems you didn't display particularly good reading skills yourself: the article said that (nearly) 2/3 of all *illiterate* people were women, not that 2/3 of all *women* were illiterate.

So, a quick calculation gives a figure of about 30% illiteracy among women -- compared to about 15% among men -- which is of course still quite horrible and indicative of the low status of women in the shitty macho- and honor-based culture of Islamic states.

Oh the irony

From the article:

"even though women's literacy rates have trebled in the past 30 years, one in every two Arab women still can neither read nor write"

Careful to read something before you criticize someone for not reading it
"There is no such a thing as Americans"

What utter nonesense. You might as well say there's no such thing as Britons or Arabs, we're all Africans really.
I've seen it mentioned many times in various, serious sources that it's a myth that it was the *Muslims* who was responsible for the advances in science and math. On the contrary, that was down to pre-Islamic Arabic culture, and the spread of Islam more or less put a stop to it by fronting an aggressive culture based on conquest and wars.

I'm not in a position to dig up any backing sources at the moment, and I've never kept track of those anyway, so I'd be grateful if someone who is knowledgeable about this issue stepped in and pointed to authorative references. (Particularly if I'm wrong!)

WoW! He's using NASA WorldWind! http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/
Whoops. That doesn't add up, though, as the article also said:

"Adult illiteracy rates have declined but are still very high: 65m adults are illiterate, almost two-thirds of them women."

Which I used as the basis for my calculation: if the complete region contains 280m people (as is mentioned near the top), I'd assume a very close approximation would be that there are 140m women. 2/3s of 65m is about 43m. 43m is approximately 30% of 140m. So it seems the article has an error..?

Edit: oh wait, one must of course subtract children under a certain age from the total before measuring illiteracy. For nations with such a large part of the population being very young, due to e.g. extremely high rates of child-birth, that would make a big dent in the starting figure of 280m. So an illiteracy rate near 50% of adult females doesn't seem unlikely.

Sorry about that, and my pardons to the thread starter for my rudeness.

&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't being a part of any religion other than Islam contitute "idolatry / blashpemy" to a Muslim?

In general, no.  If you are idolotrous (spl?) or polytheistic then you can expect to be treated pretty badly.  If you are from another monotheistic belief such as christianity then that's generally ok.  See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_other_religions) for more details.
&gt; The problem with your theory is that it assumes that Reddit readers can tell that you've submitted your own links before modding them down. Does that really happen? I seriously doubt anyone would be bothered to click through to a user's "home" page to determine this. Based on my own behaviour on Reddit (admittedly not a good metric) I think many users tend to mod down any submitted link that is obviously a blog. If it's hosted by Blogger, Typepad or even WordPress, forget about gaining Karma.

You'ld have a patch, possibly a fork, because many open source developers I meet on mailings lists do not meet criticism with "Hmm.

Then you get that software developing independantly of the patch, so it'd probably get you nowhere anything more than a serious term.

Same for Christian idolatry views, but only the fundamentalists will get annoyed at you if you do it. (Well, and some early evangelists were known to be real pains.)

It seems the same here. It seems to be a small, mostly radical Islamist faction that's raising shit, right?

There's a difference of scale of reaction, and that's interesting, but to argue about level of respect other view deserves seems odd - even if that's, in another way, exactly the general problem and point here.
Litigiousness run amok.
foo.call(5) # returns 10


Notice the .call(), rather than just foo(5).  That's an object with a call method, not a function - a strict interpretation of first class function would require that the value is treated _exactly_ the same as any other function call.  This is of course a silly argument (which is why I said it was silly), as the underlying concept is there.  In reality, ruby doesn't have first class functions because it effectively doesn't have functions - just methods, but this is a purely syntactic difference and causes no difference in functionality (just like map vs LC's)

find(f, l)

is just 8 characters - hardly a major pain.

It is a minor convenience for some things (I mentioned I'm glad its staying) - but removing it isn't any kind of rejection of functional principles.
It seems "WAH OLD" really is the "First post" of reddit. Well, that and "WAH SEEN" (e.g. Joel) or "WAH NOT MY TASTE" (Joel, Lisp, Not-lisp, programming related when there has been a lot of it lately, not programming related when there hasn't, or anything at bloody all).

I agree some things are just clutter, but with things like this... If it makes quite interesting points, is not noticably outdated by recent history, and most of us haven't read it yet (which you can generally assume), what's the problem? The same article does not lose value *merely* by having left the writer longer ago. If it's poignant, it stays so for a while.

It may be sort of interesting to have some marker that points that out for articles you may not notice are older. If only to stop the whining.

Perhaps this will -finally- put an end to the outrageous prices this bit of industry considers normal up to now.
So are you saying it is perfectly alright to treat Hindu's poorly because they believe in more gods than you?
My eyes hurt.
Is this true?  I thought that the Koran was silent on the matter and that it is a particular school of Muslim theology that forbids/restricts images of Mohammed.   Take a look at
http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007934
for a discussion of this.

It is starting to become clear that the outrage is more the result of Iran and Syria actively fanning the flames than a grassroots expression of concern about images of Mohammed.

The bigger problem is that Islamic extremists are most effective at shutting down any dissent from moderates.   Ongoing silence from other Muslims about the extremists behavior will only end in tragedy for the Muslim community.

Careful, John Stossel has a rightwing agenda.
I found a recent job on this site, so thought I would share it to more people.  Very useful!
So... what are the answers?
Anybody have a clue?
This article is uses fear uncertainty and doubt to wail against government funded safety nets. i.e. a libertarian agenda piece.
Ok, here are some answers:

-Mirror:
  A mirror reflects what hits it where it hits it.  So your feet are hitting the bottom of the mirror, but your left side is hitting the right side of the mirror.  Not sure why though?

-Sprinkler Problem:
  I'm thinking its the opposite direction, but it seems like no one knows for sure.  Here's some discussion: http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics/browse_thread/thread/739156f74d443047/ebf45c744122a40c

-Train:
Help!  I really want to know.  The searches did nothing!

Is this for real? I read the article, and it says the authorities don't know who set fire to the muslim shops. But still...
WARNING! SPOILER AHEAD:

The mirror works not by reversing left and right, but by reversing front and back.  Inverting any single direction will  change the "handedness" of the inverted object, so if I look in the mirror, you see a person who is left-handed.

A train is kept on its tracks by the fact that its wheels are conic sections, not cylinders.  If the train started to go a bit too much to the right, it would be on a wider section of the right wheels, and a narrow section of the left wheels.  This would mean that the left wheels, rotating at the same speed as the right, would cover less horizontal distance than the right, making the train turn left.

(not absolutely sure about this one)The sprinkler does not turn at all-it just sorta vibrates around.  The reason is that when it shoots the water out, the water all goes out in one direction.  When it is sucking in, the water is sucked in from all directions, so the net momentum is not as great.  

I don't have the time or the physics chops for the last one.
Very interesting. I wonder if this will become the standard input device in 10 years or so. Some of it seemed a little jerky, for example, when they zoomed in with the maps. However I thought the picture resizing and sorting stuff was neat.
there's a Flash version of the gaame he's playing at the end here:  http://www.addictinggames.com/planarity.html
Perhaps surprisingly, many adults don't understand that human children are psychologically very different creatures from human adults. The prepubescent endocrinological and CNS makeup is totally different from the adult one.

Incidentally, South Park uses these misguided adult interpretations of children's behavior and psychology as a powerful humor device. A lot of the "sordid" stuff children are up to exists only the the sordid minds of adults.
It's almost certainly real. Leh is the Buddhist part of Kashmir and the people there have always resented the Muslims who econmically and politically dominate the state. If shops were burnt down then it was definitely the Buddhist 'youth'. The Koran desecration is more likely to be an unsubtantiated rumour.

However, I'm not so sure that all the other anti-American Americans know why. (The same with the people who constantly say that humans are a disease on the Earth.) To them it seems that they like to talk about the bad things about them more.

Also, it seems very counter-productive to me. Maybe Chomsky has the correct perspective, but the others don't even seem to acknowldege any blame at all on the part of the other countries. They always conclude that the offending countries and people should be left alone and that the US should be punished for their misdeeds.

One feature I like in the current Gmail is the ability to easily [add other email accounts](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=%67mail&amp;hl=en&amp;answer=20616) without having to configure POP or SMTP. Just forward email to GMail and pick the right From address to use. Very simple and works well, except when you forget which account you want to compose/reply from (if that matters to you).
On the contrary, *taxpayer* funded safety nets are based on FUD.  What particular points in the article are you arguing with?  Back up your arguments if you want to be taken seriously.
It IS the norm!  The whole point is that the government encourages normal people, who are just looking out for themselves, to take money that's stolen from taxpayers!  The state make it easy for us to steal from each other.  There are plenty of examples given, and they are not extreme at all.

You have simply dismissed the article without a single valid argument.  Did you even read it?  It's about how the rich use the government to exploit middle class and poor taxpayers.  Talk all you like about how the article has an agenda, but unless you address the points logically, you're just being closed minded.
He actually said "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people."  

I think that means something different than the usual gloss.  Unless people generally have a more positive view of opium than I thought.

These sites are like leafing through a Chermayeff &amp; Geismar book on advertising design. They are nice in a-simple-modern art-as-advertising way, and make great contemporary online brochures, but the features they share (3d effects, lots of whitespace, nice big text, etc) do not recommend themselves to useful websites. Craigslist seems to be doing well despite violating almost all of the common features.

I especially want it to transfer seemlessly when I upgrade my computer or take it anywhere.

In fairness, a lot of this look comes from CSS letting web designers use some of the basic techniques that any typographer would already use in print (e.g. controllable leading). Also, CSS positioning is really the only usable way to copy a pixel perfect layout from a graphic mockup and its use is starting to show. I think certain aspects like use of whitespace will endure but stuff like the rounded corners, reflections, fades, pastel colours will date fast.

That's stupid.  In a free market they would be better off prosecuting items where fines are involved rather than actual crimes like Rape and Murder.  

(which also have the added disadvantage of costing incarceration fees, meaning a net loss).

I'd rather they automate the crimes they can (or prevent the crimes from happening originally) so that the human can catch the "hard" ones.  

I also think that a sensible speed limit like France, where it's 130kph on DRY roads and a reduced speed in adverse conditions, makes sense.  I also think that scaling fines based on income makes sense too.

I'd say all of your examples do lend themselves to a useful website: 3d effects on buttons help indicate that they are meant to be interacted with by giving them a tactile surface; whitespace and big text are both used to aid visual navigation. 37signals really invented a lot of this style and they pay a huge amount of attention to usability details.

But of course you cannot think of any argument.
I don't know the answer to the sprinkler question, but here are some of the forces involved.

When you're forcing water out, the sprinkler turns because the water exerts a force on the curves of the "S" which produces torque.

When you're pulling water in, the water exerts the same force on the curves, which will cause the sprinkler to turn the same way it did before.

However, since you're in the water, you also have to deal with issues of pressure. The water entering the sprinkler will create a low-pressure area near the entrance.

I don't know which will dominate.

the article leaves out the real reason Coke uses high fructose corn syrup in the USA: because the corn industry (such as Archer Daniels Midland) lobbies for steep tarriffs on imported cane sugar, which raises the price of cane sugar in the US by over 100% compared to world sugar prices... raising it just enough so that corn syrup is marginally cheaper. In a free market corn syrup would be about twice the price of cane sugar. In addition to the health problems caused by corn syrup, this hurts poor carribean cane farmers who lose access to a huge market. And the reason you haven't heard about this: huge donations from ADM to NPR.
[deleted]
... I should add that soft drinks are usually made with sugar outside the US, and if you've ever tasted them side by side there's no question that the sugar tastes much better and doesn't have the metallic aftertaste of corn syrup.

&gt;a strict interpretation of first class function would require that the value is treated exactly the same as any other function call.

Under that interpretation, Common Lisp doesn't have first class functions either because it has a separate namespace for function names and ordinary variable names, with syntax to tell them apart. Most people would not agree with a claim that Common Lisp does not have first class functions.

You mean the way libertarians are considered financially conservative and socially liberal?  Though libertarians are some of the smartest and most logical people that I know, they aren't immune from falling on a political spectrum on issues.  Argue the point: fine, but let's not pretend libertarians are in their own political dimmension.

I don't like the taste of soda made with cane sugar.

I really miss glass bottles, but not because they're returnable. Soda just tastes better when it comes that way.

I found Mexican Pepsi for sale in glass bottles, but it's made with cane sugar, so it doesn't taste right.

After a bit more research, I found that there are only three places that you can buy good HFCS Pepsi in glass bottles; the problem is that they're all in Idaho (not that Idaho sucks - I am just not able to move to the northwest right now).

I don't drink nearly enough Pepsi to worry about diabetes, and I like the taste of HFCS a lot better. I would easily pay a quarter more on top of the glass bottle premium to get what I want.
Thanks for the link. It helped me discover that my problem isn't with the so-called 37signals style, but with the particular examples given in websitesfromscratch. The 37signals focus is usability. The websitesfrom scratch page would be better titled "Current style in online brochure design", since its features lean towards marketing rather than usefulness.

I share jamesbritt's complaint of the websites listed--they are boring. But they were called out because of the common design features they share, not their content. Unfortunately, their common features amount to eye candy. "Lots of whitespace" is nice but in the examples given, "lots of whitespace" = "devoid of content", not reasonably spaced elements. The 3d effect is nice when used to denote a clickable field, but none of the examples given are clickable. Do we really want more "trademark round flashes" or "cute icons"?

I am not suggesting that there is no room for design in crafting a website, but I think that the intent of the design [listed](http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/current-style.cfm) is great for advertising, not web usability.
"Iraq never attacked America, argues Mr Buchanan, so America did not have to attack it. As for the idea that America's security depends on ending foreign tyranny, that is “noble-sounding nonsense”, writes Mr Buchanan."

He doesn't rail against *all* government funded safety nets. He rails against *specific* government funded safety nets. And even if you believe wholeheartedly in the government protecting people from misfortune, there are some theoretical safety nets that should not be built.

Or Assembler.  Seriously, some languages are just plain better than others in terms of development time.  Assembler is better than machine language, Fortran is better than Assembler, C++ and Java are better than Assembler, Ruby and Python are better than C++ and Java, and Scheme/Lisp are generally better than Ruby/Python (I say generally because the Lisp family needs improvements in its libraries so that it would be better at certain tasks.  For example, I think in many cases Ruby and Python would beat out Lisp for web development, though this will likely change soon).

In short, those languages that work at a higher level of abstraction are quicker to develop in, though they may execute less efficiently than the lower-level ones.  But developer time is much more expensive than fast hardware these days, so abstraction wins out.

Um, any observation to back this up?  

I'll no doubt make a point of trying Allegro for myself, but I'm curious as to what features inhabit the realm of "supercooler."

I've never quite understood the distinction between libertarians and anarchists.  Both are anti-authoritarian, both are ever-so-slightly scary.  Is it just that libertarians are former righties and anarchists former lefties?  Its like they're both so far out on the political spectrum that they've met again.

Are you implying fnord123 is the enemy truth or is Snaut the enemy of truth?
Unfortunately, the interpretation of the report leads me to believe that what it did was hold the goals of the west up and see how well the region meets it.

Of course they don't have democracy - it's antithesis to current or historical Islam! Of course women aren't treated as equals - it's part of the function of women having separate roles in Islam! However, it's foolhardy to believe that innovation is only possible in a democracy - look at the USSR and China. 

Perhaps democracy is optimal - I'd certainly rather live in a democratic state than a theocratic one. I'd certainly rather live in a capitalist society than a planned economy. However, it seems silly to blame the problems of the Arab world on this alone.

Likewise, the idea of blaming colonialism is silly. In sub-saharan Afric, it makes more sense. The continent was sliced up in such illogical ways and was decimated for four centuries. Their woes are the culmination of four centuries of tragedy. However, most of the Arab world had a rather short stay of colonialism. So they lost a little land to Israel - they've had more than enough money to cure the woes that such offenses brought.

Frankly, it seems like the religion itself is to blame. Those who could improve the situation; the innovators, inventors, and iconoclasts don't want to live under such restrictive rules? What would happen if we ignored the work of all atheists in the west? What if we drove them out, like Germany did Einstein and many in the Jewish brain trust that stayed in America after World War 2? What if we imprisoned and murdered homosexuals, like Turing?
yes Indeed. I am from Australia, where we have a major sugar industry, so everything uses cane sugar. And it does taste much better.

The corn syrup soft drinks overseas give me the shakes, and taste kind of metallic, very unpleasant. I feel sorry for you. 

No I am going have a nice SUGAR coke... mmm... ahhh....
The cane sugar ones aren't as sweet, but thats fine with me. The sugar used has a lower gylcaemic index.

Also, I think the myth of excessive sugar consumption causing diabetes was debunked some time ago. The other side effects are bad enough. Of course, if you are developing adult onset diabetes, high bursts of sugar will not help the first time you show symptoms  - but that is NOT the cause.
I am forced to use this awful application at work.  And even worse, they keep actual documents out under shared "Databases".  It has to be the most ungainly interface ever to grace an application.  I have basically stripped every toolbar off of it possible, and I still can't stand it.  When can IBM just re-write this POS from the ground up to be a modern application?

Oh, and the article mentions nothing about how slow this thing is.  It moves at the speed of a moth.  And don't try to view embedded images over a few kilobytes.  It will literally take 60-70% of a modern processor's resources just to render it.
I was annoyed by this too. But I haven't seen some of these tricks before so I posted it anyway.
very funny. Great find.
This was a lot more interesting 2 years ago.
Does your book share anything in common with the progenitors of the genre?
I am also forced to use Notes every day. My favorite part is that Lotus Notes and Lotus Organizer share a dll file, and if you have both programs open at the same time (common here), Organizer will soon crash and any unsaved info will be lost. IBM says well then use Notes Calendar instead, it's an upgrade, but what kind of upgrade sheds half the functionality of the original application? Give me a break.
If you read the article you will notice that the rising coast of oil is what is driving the change, that and environmental concerns.

Don't look at it in terms of left and right.  Lefties and righties just want the government to take freedom away in different areas.  Some people who call themselves anarchists simply don't respect the rights of others and are just jerks, but most just want to be left alone and are some of the most tolerant people you'll ever meet (same with libertarians).

Many libertarians are miniarchists, meaning they think the government should be restricted to performing minimal functions, of which everyone has their own preferences.  I'm an anarchist, meaning that I object to anyone having coercive power over anyone else.  Every function that the government performs can be done voluntarily, either by cooperatives or private companies competing for customers.

In that sense, libertarians believe that initiation of coercive force is right in certain situations, while anarchists believe initiation of force is NEVER right.

Libertarians and anarchists are also individualist as opposed to collectivist, meaning that they don't believe being in a certain group of people entitlies one to anything, nor does it deny one any rights.
So you do not credit the *individual* Martin Luther King, Jr. for affecting society (through his demands for equal rights under the law)?
Not sure you're right. Isn't his popularity rather low now?

**Edit**: Some Fox News article says it's at 44 percent up from a low of 39 percent. Dunno.
Your statement is outrageous! How dare you doubt that Bush also believes in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?

I've discovered that seeing how libertarianism works and government doesn't requires looking at long term, widespread, and non-obvious effects of policies.  For example, how reducing business regulation increases wages, because employers know that it is easy for their employees to quit and start their own businesses.  Employers have to pay more to keep them.  Most people don't realize this unless they have a good mental model of how a society works.

So, please don't sling such judgments around lightly, jugdementalist :)

Pretty close, but be careful how you throw around the word "Arabs".  Ironically, Jews are also Arabs.. In fact, many Arabs are semites...  I love how convoluted things are in the middle east.  :-)
The other things google has created have been a little far stretched, but the risks were usually offset by benefits.

But **this** is just idiotic.
"Government smiles in anticipation"? Does this story take place in *1984*?
What you describe is definitely a problem.  However, if history is any lesson, freedom tends to prevent wars.  The more people have the opportunity to better their situations through work and trade, the less they feel forced to fight or steal from others.

The only way to stop the state from reincarnating is through non-coercive, that is, defensive force.  Here, an armed citizenry is a must.  If people start trying to band together and boss you around, don't listen.  If they attack you, shoot them.  Once people see the benefits of freedom, hopefully it will be hard to take it away.

The worst case is that a totalitarian government will overpower all those fighting for their freedom.  But I would argue that it much easier for a cancerous government to simply grow until it becomes a nightmare, like in nazi Germany.  The more freedom there is, the more obvious threats to freedom are.
You don't have any arguments against the article.

Ryanair has been doing this for years, advertising cheap flights to destinations such as Paris and Barcelona, when the flights actually go to small regional airports.  The airline played a pivotal role in developing the low-fares flights market in Europe. However, now that so many European carriers are more favourably priced and Ryanair has introduced extra baggage fees, there's little reason to fly with them...

Mirror: Take a piece of paper. Write "R" on it. Look at it. Now hold it up to a mirror.

Wait! Stop right there. When you held it up to the mirror, what did you do? You rotated it about its Y axis. This was arbitrary, and the reason why the mirror image has the same top and bottom as the R did before.

If you had rotated it about its X axis, left and right would be preserved and top and bottom would be inverted.

This article isn't libertarian in its tone. The basic points are:

* The government shouldn't give tax dollars to rich people or large corporations.
* The governmnet shouldn't help people to do stupid things like build houses in a flood zone.

A libertarian would argue that the government shouldn't redistribute wealth at all (no food stamps, social programs, etc...). The author was very specific about what he thought needs to stop.
No, looking at facts, libertarianism causes massive unemployment and a massive  increase in GDP in the top 10% of the population. Just like what is found in every nation subjected to the IMF's Washington Consensus. For example: Argentina.
I was giving a preview for anyone else who reads comments before the article, like me.
"But if there's no minimal government to enforce the law, libertarianism is just wishful thinking."

I think you have confused libertarianism with anarchy.  Libertarians believe there is a role for the government and that role includes police and national defense.

Would replacing 'causes' with 'encourages' satisfy you? When I origninally referred to King, I said he had an "effect" which was what you claimed an individual cannot have.

Furthermore, Dr. King also motivated non-blacks who may not have acted without his leadership. I am not a racist; an apology is in order.

To say that "things would have turned out the same" if an individual as influential as Dr. King had never existed is absurd.

An interesting book, yes. Factual? Well, not quite. Worth reading as long as you keep in mind that Raymond knows basically nothing about non-UNIX systems. Most of his contextual commentary is simply incorrect, sometimes even contradicted by the sources he cites. 

Best read in conjunction with The UNIX Hater's Handbook (http://reddit.com/goto?id=01770) and the Raymondism FAQ (http://reddit.com/goto?id=178l). Helps the reader develop perspective. :)

Even further than that, can we stop sexualizing teenagers and adults?  Unsexualize them?  I really don't like having to avoid saying or doing anything that could be accidentally construed as sexual.
"I'm sorry to break it to you, but unless you want to stap a bomb onto yourself and die for what you believe in, you can't change a god damn thing."

Are you implying that people that do that kind of thing do benefit the case they're promoting? Cause I can't see it, to be honest. The lot of e.g. the Palestinean people hasn't improved over the last few years, as far as I can see.

The only thing I can see that will improve the situation is politics getting more transparent and people getting noisy about wrongs and for example pushing for upper limits(or abolition) on those sea side insurances.
Boy, did that bring back memories...sigh

Not necessarily.  Organization is not a power structure by definition.  I am employed at-will.  That means that my employer and I are both free to terminate the contract at any time, for whatever reason.  We have different responsibilities - he is responsible for the whole company, while I specialize my work.  We continue our relationship as long as it is benefial for both of us.

The term for this type of organization is unanimous consent -- anyone can opt out of participation, but they cannot force anyone else to go along.  In a democracy, the minority can never opt out, and the majority can force the minority to follow their rules.

Democracy is force disguised as freedom.  Just reduce it to the simplest form: three people, two of whom steal from the third.  Even if the groups change over time, it's still theft.
This is actually truer than it seems! Modern thermodynamics has shown that it is not the processing of information but the *deletion* of information that fundamentally must dissipate heat (specifically, at least kT*log(2) per bit erased; this is known as Landauer's Principle). You can in fact think of your heat sink as as a "data sink", dumping out waste information into the environment in the form of entropy.

(Another amusing note: In Windows, you can actually unload the NULL driver if you so desire. Just write a program running with administrator privileges to call NtUnloadDriver on it. Then catting anything to NUL will fail! :)
True, that's one of my major beefs.  A project I'm doing that I planned to use Lisp for is running on Ruby because it's so hard to get a decent Lisp implementation for free of the web.

We need a Lisp!
Wow, haven't seen that sad little slap in a while. Care to provide evidence for your claim? Be sure to reconcile it with Jefferson's words in a letter to T. M. Randolph (http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/foleyx-browse?id=Government,%20Works%20on.): "Locke's little book on government is perfect as far as it goes." Words and actions are different things, however, and any honest student will grant that Jefferson's presidency was hardly a time of a humble night-watchman state.

History has shown over and over that Patrick Henry and the so-called "anti-federalists" were correct on every count, but nationalists such as Jefferson, Madison, et al. opposed them.

Yes, Jefferson had his flaws, but I'd be thrilled to see a Jeffersonian candidate break the deathgrip that this mad run of statists has had on the U.S. presidency. I could even live with a return to King George's "tyrannical" three-percent tax rate.
It's easy to get a decent Lisp implementation -- SBCL or CMUCL -- if you run on Unix. However, they don't run on Windows.

CLISP runs on Windows but has some scarey license issues (see http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2005/12/reddit-and-lisp-psychosis.html). Franz has a great product, by all accounts, but the license would give my employer hives. That leaves Lispworks, I guess. 

I love the _idea_ of Lisp, and I can't quite keep myself from playing with it, but selling it to managers is much, much harder than it needs to be.
Shit.

Here I am crying at work again.
Dunno how that relates.

Your comment was overly simplistic. If you believe that the world is as simple as indicated by your above comment (and perhaps you don't, as per winky), then you are a simple fool.

Nothing in your response is something that I don't already understand. It is also overly simplistic.
I'll play devil's advocate because I like the abuse.

...but I don't run on Unix.  Ruby, at least, has a Windows port that is capable of GETting from the Web.  I did have a Lisp, xlisp I think, but it was for DOS, and completely web-unaware.

By decent I mean:
1. Can be had for either Windows, Unix, etc., with minimal to no modification (of the Lisp code) required between OS's.
2. Free software that's not crippled.
3. Lots of libraries.

I love Lisp too.  Sometimes I use it as pseudo-code to guide my writing of code in another language.  Even built a hardware design (!) using a Lisp-syntax state machine description as pseudo-code (which, by the way, I actually tested and ran).

Though I would agree that essentially John is a libertarian, you have to know a little of his history to understand the underpinnings of the article. 

Originally, John wanted to go after big businessmen who were sticking it to the little guy.  He wanted to stick a camera in the face of the successful gas store owner and say "Hey, bub, why are you ripping people off to the tune of $2.50 a gallon here in the city, when you competition down the street if only charging $2.30??  Huh??  HUH??"

After a few times doing that, when the owner says "Um, because people pay it.  Why don't you go find out where the $1.20 in taxes go?" he decided to do just that.  And he discovered that the State, in the form of corporate welfare, fame subsidies and whatnot, is ripping off Joe Consumer much more than the free market.

Since then, he has been tracking down the answer to the question "Why do I give a quarter of my paycheck to the government?"  I think it is a reasonable question, no matter what your politics.  I hope you all do too.

I didn't know that about Brillo. That's really interesting, and reminds me of what Prodigy didn't do.

Remember Prodigy, the online service? IBM and Sears founded it as a way to get people to shop online. What they discovered, to their chagrin, is that the two most popular parts were the bulletin boards and the email.

Since people using email weren't obviously profitable the way people buying stuff are, Prodigy did an amazingly stupid thing. They limited users to 30 free emails per month. After that, users had to pay 25 cents per message (the cost of a stamp back then) Users were upset, and over the next few years, AOL stole all their customers.

If Prodigy had instead embraced this trend, it would have had the explosive growth AOL did. Instead, the service was basically dead by the mid-90s. Prodigy was sitting on a gold mine and blew it.

Of course, IBM made a similar mistake with DOS, so maybe it was in their blood.

While pointing out the foodstuffs left to the free market were not (and would not be) in short supply, Stossel left out a relevant political point: Food production, on the massive, national sustenance level, is a national security issue. 

If a developed nation with solid technology went completely free market, it would likely preserve the ability to be self-sustaining for some time due to competitive technological advantage. But as the technology got cheaper and the developed nation's land and manpower more expensive, more and more would be sent outside its borders.

Most likely, the biggest worry would be high tariffs on a particular foodstuff or two when country A wasn't getting along with country B, but I can almost hear the Senator from the great state of (your farm-subsidy happy state **Here**) railing on against the perils of letting other countries hold the food supply hostage.....
Fine, what's your alternative? Intentionally make Iraq a bad place? Give as little control as possible to its people?
Gaza never was historically part of Israel, and the Israeli public in general viewed Sharon's giving it to the Arabs in a very positive way. 

The West Bank, however, and of course Jerusalem, are viewed differently, because they are historically part of the nation of Israel. Of course, Jerusalem historically, even so-called "Arab East Jerusalem", was a Jewish city. A hundred years before Israeli independence, a plurality of East Jerusalem was Jewish, and by the 1870s East Jerusalem was majority Jewish. This was before Zionism. The only reason why East Jerusalem became, as the media calls it now, "Arab East Jerusalem" was because Jordan ethnically clensed it.

This is nothing like the expansionist Muslim concept of Dar Al Islam. Jews want to live in Israel in peace, Israel is a very small country and there's no reason to begrudge it to the Jewish people because the Arabs took it over for a while.
Were those other 150 about privacy concerns? Many people, myself included don't like the constant stream of Google hype, but I think this is important. This is the very kind of problem that needs to be addressed with education and exposure. Privacy issues like this need to be solved with awareness and consumer choice, not with laws and lawsuits. Infact its the laws and lawsuits that we are afraid of here.

This is not the normal Google is building timetravel!!11 This IS reddit and newsworthy.
Don't forget to look at the other side of the picture: by the time our food supply is outsourced enough that the prospect of losing it has become quite serious, the countries we buy the food from will have become so dependent on the input of American dollars that the prospect of losing *that* would have become quite serious. (After all, they must be doing SOMETHING with those dollars they receive - and finding a way to do that something in a different way might not be easy.)

Every American dollar sent overseas must eventually be sent back to buy something in America!
I think this doomsday view is incorrect.  The article provides the counter example:

"But farmers who grow beans, pears, and apples receive no government subsidies, and they thrive. Free markets are best at producing ample supplies of everything."

American's (or any bunch of free people) when faced with competition get innovative.  They find alternative ways of farming, that produce greater harvests, allowing them to compete with countries whose only quality is cheaper workforce.  

Guess what?  Everyone wins - we all get cheaper and more abundant or higher quality food .
Jews and Arabs are both Semites, but Arabs are Ishmaelites while Jews are Israelites. We're closely related but not both Arabs, and all Arabs are Semites. (Maybe you're thinking of Muslims, many Muslims aren't Arabs - Iran for example is ethnically Persian and Indonesia, the highest Muslim population in the world, is not even in the Middle East much less Arab.)
There's surprisingly serious attempts to sketch out (for example) an advanced industrial economy with mechanisms guarding against power solidifying in the hands of a few. [Participatory Economics](http://www.zmag.org/parecon/indexnew.htm) is one.

They seem to welcome criticism, just like some developers welcome bug reports and security audits... True, it's hard to sketch out something so complicated in any detail, and one must assume there will be institutional fuzz left out of their model which would appear in any real world economy. But it's an interesting first approximation, and I think they have a real econ [hacker's](http://www.zmag.org/Instructionals/EconVision/default.htm) mindset, so they discuss the building blocks they used, in order that you might build your own system and evaluate whether it meets your goals.
Ah.  I think I see.  So the EM field carries momentum counterrotational to the wheel?  Is the induced magnetic field from the rotating charged disk significant?

I thought the workers *can* own and control the rights of production.  You can purchase shares in the stock market.  Or even start your own business.  Begin consulting or teaching.  Write a book or articles.  Do contract works (and reuse some of the products in future contracts).  All sorts of ways of owning the products of your labour.  I think we are already there.
This is actually already possible with Hotmail / LiveMail, but I personally still prefer gmail over both of those.

Well ok, I'll give it a like vote for the sheer entertainment value. But it gets a B- for technical merit. For one thing, when a bubble is still regenerating, it makes a "pop" of the same magnitude as a full bubble. This unrealistic constancy is distracting. Moreover, part of the value of real bubble wrap is being able to fold it over and pop multiple bubbles at once - functionality which is sadly lacking in this virtual version.
Insulin bursts, caused by sudden absorption of rapidly digestible carbohydrates, are known to contribute to type II diabetes. Foods high in refined starches and sugars are the primary culprints.
You need to give a clear definition of power then.  I'd propose we define power as the ability to use force (or threat of force) to cause someone to do what they don't want to.  If I did my work because I was afraid of being fined, going to jail, or being shot, then my boss would have power over me.  

What you are describing is influence.  I'd agree that my boss has influence over me, but that's only because I allow him too.  It might be inconvenient to quit, but if I decided that my boss was trying to abuse me and I'd be better off quitting, I have that option.  If he tried to use force to keep me working, I could defend myself.

Whereas, if someone uses legitimized *power* to do bad things, you're pretty much screwed.  Try defending yourself from an omnipresent, powerful state!

From my point of view, the idea that any government is either morally right or beneficial is naive.  I'm wondering about your last statement that any power structure can be used for bad.  Why is democracy any different?  What is there to stop a democracy from doing something stupid like electing Hitler, or Hamas?

Think about it - how much money is there to be made in a libertarian society as the private security company that successfully defended its customers against the rise of fascism?  Once there are several competing security companies, no single one can take over.  And, without restrictions on the market, collusion is impossible since nothing is stopping all the young upstarts from starting their own private defense firms.  The rise of the conglomerate corporation is a direct result of the ever-growing power of government, which small companies are much less able to defend against and use to their unfair advantage (getting subsidies, for example).
Described beautifully. How come you left the name of the political/economic term out?

*Interdependence* FTW!
There's a term for those who don't believe in land/natural resource ownership, I think it's geo-libertarian.  It's one thing that I have a really tough time forming an opinion on.  I guess I tend to agree with Locke, but then how do you resolve a dispute where two people try to use the same land?  I guess each could own the part that they developed first...
If you want to debate, then I will debate.  I'm not interested in dismissive name-calling.

Tell me why you think that government is an appropriate solution to a particular problem, and I will tell you why I disagree.  To give you a head start, I'll tell you that my argument will probably include that the problem to be solved is caused by government in the first place, since that is so often the case.  If you want to catch me off guard, pick a problem that is not caused by the government.

I cited this quote in an comment about the "Welfare Queen" article, but it's appropriate here too:

"When buying and selling are controlled by legislation, the first things to be bought and sold are legislators" - P.J. O'Rourke.

Most people with any kind of sense agree that corporate welfare is wrong, but power will always be abused.  It's the result of people following the laws of economics and maximizing their own self interest.
I think you mixed up right and left there... he's looking at a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich (one enabled and even mandated by government power, no less!) and saying, "Hey, this is wrong and should stop!" How the heck is that &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; wing?

&gt;Measure behavior rather than claims. del.icio.us doesn't have stars because why would you bookmark something that was no good? This way people bookmark things that they really care about rather than trying to tell the system things.

This would be my favorite piece of advice from the page. That's the beauty of the free market (measuring money, not claims) and Google's PageRank algorithm (measuring links, not claims).

On the other hand, there are counter-examples like eBay's reputation system, which is based on customer feedback. The number of items sold by a vendor is a useful number, but only in relatively large numbers that don't occur naturally in a many-to-many auction market.

this is just speculation:

karma could have influence in the algorithm that mixes date-hotness and votes; as in, if your karma is high, when you submit a story it gets a hidden boost that lets it get nearer the top of the hot listings with fewer positive votes, which gives it more of a chance of getting a greater number of votes overall; which makes sense because your high karma makes it more likely that the community will benefit from more early attention to your posts.

that way, all votes are equal, but karma still matters.

The article raises concerns that a single speed Bluray drive will be too slow, but no one has even announced a single speed Bluray drive. Most of them are 4x so far. Since there aren't even singel speed drives available, it seems unlikely Sony would use them.

Sony makes tons of money off the Playstation and Microsft loses billions on the xbox. To assume Sony would can it's bestseller seems a little weird. Especially since both companies think their consoles are the key to gain dominance in the livingroom.
I second that, also another thing about indexed data off site is that who knows how many backups google will make to insure fail-safe. Most techies know that data is really hard to erase off a HD, and with large amounts of data such as this who knows if a couple back ups get misplaced?
eliazar said "Now that I think about it, the quote contradicts reddit's entire premise, doesn't it?"

Well, I guess it does, but then, if you remove the user-feedback aspect of reddit, you get google, or maybe del.icio.us - and those are already done. The point is multiple people rate it, not just the poster.

You pick something that you *don't* like about government, and tell me how you intend to prevent a government springing up and doing it without having a whole bunch of people working together to stop it. You know, working together like a government.

I don't think this is an attack on Google as such.  What the EFF wants is a change in the law to give personal data on remote servers the same protection as data stored on your own PC.  Software is going this way and the law needs to catch up.  Google's new desktop search is just an extreme example that makes a good target for publicising the issue.
Thats one of the things that annoys me about lisp, and is a big reason why I prefer scheme.

I'd say that replacing user-rating from reddit with behavior algorithms will get you something that hasn't been done yet, but that's similar to Technorati. This new reddit would roam (or get pings from) *just* the blogosphere, gathering all the recent outbound links, and parsing them as votes à la PageRank. It would then algorithmically cluster these links into broad flavors (technology, politics, nsfw, etc...) and update these lists as frequently as it is technically feasible.

What this new reddit would answer is _What great thing the blogosphere has just found out?_ --not _What great talk the blogosphere has just spurted_? (as Technorati does), nor _What is great in the web according to the web?_ (as Google does).

A mighty cool website that would be, methinks.

Maybe you applied for your first job / internship during the bubble or something, but ever since the burst (though I admit the situation is getting slightly better) people with little real life work experience follow the "beggers can't be choosers" motto.

No - _your_ left side will hit the left side of the mirror, but the _image's_ left side will be on the right - but the image's left side is really an inversion of your right side.  The thing that confuses people is that we expect the image to behave the same as if we had turned to face ourself - ie. a rotation, rather than the actual inversion done by the mirror.    This throws off our intuition because we _expect_ the left side to correspond to our right when in fact it doesn't.

Modded down because of the multiple exclamation points. If you don't want people to think it's spam, don't make it look like spam.
From the article

"The privacy problem arises because the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986, or ECPA, gives only limited privacy protection to emails and other files that are stored with online service providers—much less privacy than the legal protections for the same information when it's on your computer at home."

It's not really in the service provider's hands to offer greater protection.  If the law says they have to hand over your data then they'll have to do so.

&gt; There are a lot of people who are working hard, and you're some of them. And I want to thank you for what you're doing. Oftentimes, you don't get recognized enough by the citizens. We take your work for granted often. But I know how hard you're working, and I want to thank you for that. And the federal government has a responsibility to help you in your work.

I beg to differ - any number of companies have absolutely inane hiring policies and the more people read about the way Joel hires, the more (hopefully) get it through their head that just because they've got tons of cash/are looking to sell the joint to the highest bidder, they shouldn't throw a job offer at everyone who walks in the door.
I also tend to think Joel's pretty good on occasion, but this doesn't even have much to say except "here's how our internship hiring is going". Kinda neat to read about but nothing terribly insightful there. It seems like people just submit the latest JoS blog entries to reddit every time it's updated.

Thanks for trying but none of those are what I was thinking of. My point was not very important... simply that Bush believes in more than just cronyism. He has his religious beliefs, his beliefs regarding government's function, etc. I think that these beliefs guide his decisions (including hiring) as much as cronyism.
I don't really care about game consoles. I don't care about HDTV. What I do care about is the dumbness of companies that stall a perfectly usable data medium format for the sake of a video format that has no visible difference to the old one on screens smaller than 1-1.5 meters while at the same time ignoring the fact that they could have those resolutions on standard dual-layer DVDs today if they just used reasonable compression like e.g. Xvid.

How do you rate privacy stories? If you routinly demote google stories, but promote privacy/eff stories, you'll probably see this.
So your main critique of anarchy is that it isn't practical... that the state will inevitably return?  I can deal with that.


Courts can easily be provided privately.  If I were to start a private court, I'd take great pains to provide the fairest judgement possible, in the interest of getting more clients.  In any case, the person ultimately responsible for enforcing property rights is the victim, or the victim's friends and family.  If someone steals from you, you hire people to catch them.  Once they're caught, they have two choices - pick a court that you find acceptible, or go to jail.


You might ask, what is to prevent you from falsely accusing someone, and only accepting courts that always rule in the victim's favor?  Well, if it became evident that you were doing so, the accused could accuse YOU of initiating aggression in the form of fraud, and charge you right back!  And if you were convicted, you'd be paying all the court costs.  In the end, any kind of fraud just results in a big waste of time and money for the perpetrator.


When courts are private and competing, everyone has a chance of getting their case heard, and it prevents people from trying to manipulate the courts, as well as keeping costs down.  Not to mention that our current system doesn't work so well if you try to sue the government.  Don't fall for the common fallacy that just because we need courts, we need a monopolistic provider of courts.  That's like saying that since food is necessary, the government must provide food, or that only the government should have guns.


You do have a good point.  I can't guarantee that some group of people won't slowly and secretly build up an army and try to take over, but I'd rather take my chances starting from anarchy then constantly worrying that my own government is going to go Kim Jong Il on me some day.


I think, however, that as people become more attuned to the danger of the state, it will become harder and harder to convince us that the state is even necessary.  I mean, we're arguing now about whether government is inevitable, rather than whether it is a good thing -- we both know that initiation of force is bad.  I suppose anarchy can only work if the people are wise, and if the growth of government is reversed peacefully until it disappears.  Which is why I'm having this discussion in the first place :)  If we all sit satisfied with the government, it WILL grow and we WILL be living in hell, it's just a matter of time.

Oh, wow, just looking through this I'm already quite intrigued by some of the concepts that Lisp has - such as functions actually being a data type.

I want to learn more, although Graham's preface says that this book is intended for those with at least some knowledge of Lisp already.

Can anyone recommend some great beginners books to learn Lisp?
Because no-one likes pdf's...

HTML is so much more functional.

Edit: Having actually looked at the page, I have to agree that the font is pretty terrible, though.
Actually, I found that the source article to be much more interesting and engaging than this ... which did little more than say, "Yeah ... what he said!" offering no new insight.
How about changing the CSS stylesheet at the very bottom of the page? I''ve changed and found some of them more readable than the original ...
Can you point me to a resource that explains your particular position in detail?  At first glance it sounds utterly ridiculous.

For example, suppose I go out and kill a man (let's call him Bob) in cold blood, out in the open where everyone can see.  But Bob has no friends or family.  Did I just get away with murder?  (And if you say that some indignant bystander will prosecute me, then consider that I could have been somewhat more discreet in killing Bob, so anyone who suspected me of it would have to work much harder.)

You might say, that in such a society, you had better make friends.  Well I say that if justice is about having friends, and not just friends, but well-enough-to-do friends, then it doesn't sound like justice to me.  America's streets are filled with the down-and-out, and although they are often denied justice, their cause would seem doubly hopeless in an anarchist state.

It's nothing special, but it's still moderately interesting to read.  I feel that it was worth the 2 minutes it took of my life.

It's a blog post, not an essay.  Just because it's not profoundly insightful doesn't make it 'garbage'.
Excellent. This little project further shows that Google is sorely lacking an intuitive user interface. When people search for images and subsequently follow a link, their first expectation is to see an independent photo--not a tacked-on frame header over the originating page. Context should be of secondary concern.
This has been covered in the news on and off recently.  Major drawbacks of using brain imaging as a practical lie-detection method are that it (1) is expensive; (2) requires elaborate methods, facilities, and expert technicians; (3) requires the cooperation of the subject.

fMRI (the method described [sort of] in the article) measures changes in blood flow (and blood oxygenation) in the brain.  It requires that the subject lie *motionless* (nearly) in a NMR scanner and participate in the interview/interrogation.  Lie detection would require three types of scan: a structural scan (a regular MRI to find landmarks in the particular subject's brain so that activity can be mapped to functional regions); a baseline functional scan (while the subject is being truthful or perhaps just resting); an experimental/interrogation scan (while the subject is being questioned and may or may not be telling lies).  The running of these scans, the design of the procedure, and the data analysis are all non-trivial.  Needless to say, I can't see police depts. adopting this method anytime soon.  Maybe the CIA/NSA type folks would have the resources, but the subject-cooperation is still a big issue.

Finally, it is a leap to say that subjects cannot defeat this method in the same way that polygraphs are defeated.  It may be harder to do, but bloodflow *is* just one more physiological measure.  By adopting covert strategies one might muddle this measure (e.g., the subject might recall of a time that he or she was deceptive during the baseline functional scan and thereby render the difference between the baseline and the interrogation scan very small/non-existent).

Nice application spin to get grant money by the researchers, however.
Wow, games? This employee should get the chair.
I don't know if this has been posted already. If it was, I am sorry. 

This article points out how the Danish paper Jyllands-Posten might actually have a double standard when it comes to using religious symbols in their editorial cartoons. The paper is making a disingenuous claim to the right of "freedom of speech" when publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed and then censoring offensive depictions of Jesus. 

This does not mean that the Muslim mobs have a right to do what they are doing, but it does give some evidence to what some Muslims are claiming as bigotry against Muslims.

The standard reply for this is Peter Siebel's Practical Common Lisp. I have seen it at B&amp;N, but you can get it online at:

They clearly say this in their website.
"I think certain aspects like use of whitespace will endure but stuff like the rounded corners, reflections, fades, pastel colours will date fast."

The whitespace growth is a good thing, and (hopefully) will endure.  This is Web design catching up with the basic principles of technical writing and presentation.

whether or not he has the degree is irrelevant... the fact that he *lied* about it is what makes him unqualified.  (IMnsHO)

Also, the fact that whoever appointed him didn't check this out indicates that they aren't doing their job correctly either, and should be reprimanded.  

Honestly, there should be an audit of every appointee of the Bush Administration to make sure they are "on the level" and not some con artist that just did some favor and lied to get into their current (prestigious) job.

They *definately* should encrypt the data on their servers. Its not rocket science.

anyway, I heard from a friend on /. about this great new product Google's releasing soon:

Announcing GAP!
---------------

By user demand, Google introduces Google Anal Probe Beta (hereafter GAP). GAP searches that last gap of yours that we haven't been able to reach. We will be able to recommend foods you might like, various restaurants and whether you've ever been abducted by aliens.

"Google, is this painful?" you might ask. Not anymore! Thanks to GooLube Beta you won't feel a thing.
&gt;Well, if it became evident that you were doing so, the accused could accuse YOU of initiating aggression in the form of fraud, and charge you right back!

Uh... no, they couldn't, they'd be in my private prison. I don't see any reason to expect that fairer courts would get more "clients". I don't see any reason that a private court with sufficient access to force that it can enforce its own judgment is any better (or different) than a government court.

Consider the government in unincorporated territory in the old west. Tell me how that is different from and aviodable in your anarchist fantasy.
Last time I checked office passwords were purely for show, proper cryptanalytic attack cracks them in no time flat.
Of course, last time I checked is two office version ago, but still. 

Unless you add some consistent encryption that google doesn't know about - which makes it, you know, unindexable, destroying the point.

Google encrypting your data would be pointless. If they can decrypt it, there is no reason they wouldn't be able to give it in response to a subpoena.

But yes, if this isn't optional it would be a privacy pain.
If smell is a good criterion, I am *definitely* bakin some brownies ...
That's "civilization" at its best. Poor woman.
A newspaper might perhaps be said to censor when it suppresses information with news value. For example, way back in the 1950s or 1960s, The Washington Post used coverage or not of a minor riot to press the then government of DC for some reforms.

Every newspaper, though, every day makes judgments about what is worth printing. A negative judgment does not usually amount to censorship. In this case, the cartoonist made one judgment on his cartoons, and the editor made another.

Muslims who feel put upon can throw down their $10 at the local movie theaters when "The Da Vinci Code" opens and revel in a flick that won't be pleasing pope or parsons.

I tend to roll my eyes when someone decides to ban Windows from their office.  Depending on what kind of people you have using computers in your office, banning Windows is just not a good idea.  My mother, for example, can hardly use the easiest, most mature features of Windows (such as moving a file from one folder to another).  I can't imagine her trying to do anything with Linux.

Don't get me wrong, Windows is pretty bad.  But viable alternatives for common users are quite rare.
How inflation and taxes eat into investments returns.  What safe alternatives are available.
What are they, and how to use them best to your advantage.
Simple investment strategy to achieve financial independence.
How to make sure your retirement accounts are funded correctly?  Spreadsheet and tools.
What it really costs to own a car.
I think that's the most important thing. If everyone is doing 75 on a 55 road, one car doing 55 is going to be dangerous through things like reaction time and 'I can do that' calculations being thrown.

In this case everyone slowed down, so it was only the assholes that created dangerous situations, like the guy illegally using that lane to pass them, also demonstrating people miscalculate distance an speed a lot - and that's partly the point; even at slightly over 55 he damn near crashed his car. Stationary object vs. 75 might have been fatal, (though he wouldn't have done quite this).
Is that a *"It's not the falling I'm worried about, it's the bit where you stop falling"* thing ?:)
If you killed Bob in the open, someone would call the police, just like today.  If you killed Bob discreetly, how would today's police do a better job of finding out about it?  The problems you describe neither condemn private police nor support government police.

As far as the down-and-out, there are many high-crime places where government police do not respond to calls because they are afraid, and they don't get paid more for better performance.  In a free society, the down and out would be able to buy guns for much cheaper and protect themselves, as well as have better access to justice.  The poor being denied justice is a symptom of our government monopoly on justice.
I don't have too much time to argue now.  See "An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: the not so Wild, Wild West" [http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/3_1/3_1_2.pdf], page 14.  Crime was far, far less serious in the wild west than in most cities today.

This comments section is getting too big :/  Email me at my reddit username @gmail.com if you wanna keep debating.
I don't think it depends on the kind of people using the computers. The kind of tasks they need to do are far more important in the decision wether you can ban Windows or not.
i am as anti-windows as it's possible to get, but i'm voting against this article.  the author is just nit-picking.  he says he hasn't run windows in years and is then surprised that there are problems getting started?  imagine that!  you'd have a heck of a lot *more* trouble sitting down in front of a linux box for the first time in years.

i happen to know the poster and can say that, despite his claims to be 'windows free', i have seen him set up, troubleshoot, and remotely assist three windows users (one whitebox from scratch) in the last six months. i also unpacked two dell boxes at my old office that blue screened within two hours. as far as i'm concerned, if a task can be done without xp it saves an office time and money to figure out how.
My office, my callcenter, my coding team, and my mother all use the same non-Windows platform. Desktops and laptops.

Macintosh.
I think a Mac would probably work just fine, but that's just me.  I've seen non-technical people including my girlfriend, bestfriend, mother, sister, and a slew of friends sucessfully switch.  

I also think it's reasonable to expect an employee to be able to learn to use the tools we have.  "we" however is a startup software company so that's why I can afford brashness.  

I just *hope* that more people will realize that it can be better or offer a competitive solution.  We have a windows box because we need some features (testing IE, some financial/accouting software, etc) that we can't live without.  

I believe there are other startups/small companies that don't use windows except for testing.
At least here in Europe hunters usually care about the population of the animals they hunt at least as much as the general population. If it would be a cultural thing, shouldn't the Japanese care about that too?

Umm, this is from 2000.

I got rid of XP for 2000. It's faster and seems more secure. BTW I only have a windows installed for testing IE for web sites I developed. gnu/Linux for me -no ad-ware, no viruses, no reboot to install software and to install stuff I just run the 'command apt-get install aProgram'. Ah bliss
I'd also recommend Paul Graham's own ANSI Common Lisp: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133708756/

I liked it slightly better than Practical Common Lisp for getting the Lisp way of thinking across...  Not as much, um, practical code, though.

Oh, and if you really want an "aha" experience then there's 
Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp by Norvig: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558601910/ which both introduces Common Lisp and takes you all the way up through writing classical AI systems using it.
Which is why using this as an example of "us" being better than "them" is dumb. But the article doesn't do that at all.
True, I guess that doesn't not qualify as 'what's new online', but only I realized after I submitted.  I still thought it was a good read though.
I'd be curious to know this as well.  I emailed Paul Graham a few months ago asking for permission to print a dead trees copy of OnLisp using an on-demand printing service such as Lulu.com.

He assured me that plans are in the works to republish the book...

old news
Practical common lisp
You make a really good point.  I suppose the main difference is that we have much better access to information today.  The spread of information always supports truth more than lies, which is why communists/fascists censor information.   I'd proposed that there's a sort of tipping point with anarchy, when enough people realize that it is the best system *as long as the state does not return*.  And the only thing that can prevent the return of the state is awareness, at least until the anarchy stabilizes.  I don't think that tipping point has been reached, but I'm fighting to bring it nearer.

I'm gonna have to say that you're right -- anarchy won't work unless people realize that it's the best option.  The early United States was ... well, close.  The government was created to protect our rights, but it doesn't protect us from itself.  At least the founding fathers tried to build a self-regulating system, which was much better than any previous government.  I'm hoping that each new nation gets closer and closer to anarchy.
As does yours. 

A lot of work and organization was done by a lot of people in the civil rights movement, but we don't know their names or their accomplishments.

We do, however, remember "I have a dreama".

And MLK's deeply religious beliefs led him to maintain that protest and CIVIL disobediance was the path to changing america. We could've very well had someone like Rev. Al Sharpton, who used his influence to incite race riots. 

So, yes, really, "MLK is not significant" is about as absurd as saying "why are you even posting on the internet? The Sun's going to burn out in 69 trillion years and when it goes, we're all gonna be forgotten."

Cancer treatments can be mind numbingly expensive.  Particularly if the prognosis was less than great, a family man may not have wanted to offload hundreds of thousands in debt onto his kids and wife.

We're also living in a heavily indebted society.  It's a bad call - but there are a lot of people out there who simply aren't able to raise a quarter million dollars all that easily.  

This is both unforgivable and unconsionable.  Wrongfull death suit?  If a doctor had done this it would be murder one.

Exactly right... some people have no idea that chemotherapy can run into the tens of thousands of dollars per treatment.  Even a rather wealthy person would rapidly come up against a wall trying to bank it personally.

Further... this is what health insurance companies (supposedly) *do*.  *This* is their business: supporting the customer financially in the case of "catastrophic" medical problems.  If they don't support clients who have such needs, then their only business is fraud. I understand that these companies must review claims to prevent fraud or frivolous claims from dishonest doctors and clients.  However, they reflexively reject claims too often-- financial losses from fraud are recoverable; delayed or missed medical treatments lead to permanent loss (of health and life).  It's especially obscene when you remember that the money they refuse to dole out was *given* to them by people like this patient.
&gt; I'm gonna have to say that you're right -- anarchy won't work unless people realize that it's the best option.

We agree.

How about summing up your most important statements and ideas - that I feel are a bit scattered through out your articles - 
and putting them on one page, Paul? 
Little more than headlines and maybe one sentence and a link to a longer explanation. 
Sometimes I just know you wrote something interesting but I cannot tell in which article.

&gt;&gt; "The reality is the blame-and-shame game isn't going to get us anywhere. We are all at fault," Christopher said.

IMHO the blame-and-shame game is not going far enough. Those within the insurance company responsible for the denial of treatment must be brought up on charges -- and do time!
This seems like a situation where an ambitious lawyer (or firm) could make the case for a premeditated crime. The insurance company had ample medical evidence they were killing a man and willingly refused treatment, essentially the same thing as premeditated murder by drawn out torture.
You're right. The interface of mainstream image-searchers is not only unintuitive but cumbersome right now. There's a reason why they do it like that though: presenting the independent photo directly (not to say *in* the page as in this website) is sure to be perceived as hotlinking by an angered many. I believe this is an outdated point of view, with the modern commoditization of bandwith, the full-size image is the new thumbnail --it's a preview of what's inside your website. You're in your right to block this usage, to be sure, but doing so will increasingly exclude yourself more and more from the conversation.
that's one severely misleading title. it should read more like, "woman fights with polar bear, owes her life to bystander with a gun who scared bear away".

brave of her to take it on unarmed, to be sure, but if it hadn't been for the unnamed bystander who only gets mentioned in the second-to-last graf, she'd be dead.

I work in the health care field in an area which involves payers (entities which are usually insurance companies).

It is standard operating procedure for insurance companies to arbitrarily deny claims for virtually no reason whatsoever.  They do this because they know the cost of pursuing the claim is too great to be worthwhile for the doctor.

The proper way to fix healthcare in this country is not to focus on malpractice which is a small amount by comparison.  The place to focus is on getting payers to cough up the amounts they are contractually obligated to pay.

Unfortunately, you can imagine who has the greater lobbying power: insurance companies or doctors so I don't expect any significant reform any time soon.

This article, as sad as it is, seems clearly intended to be a hit piece against the insurance company. It leaves out EVERY relevant detail that might explain the company's behaviour or the other options that woulda/shoulda/did/weren't tried. If the company was as in the wrong as the article implies I, as the author, would cover those issues just to make it clear. Leaves one wondering what's left out. 

Insurance is purely a contract issue. Things are either covered or they're not. Obviously some contracts are better than others and one should definitely evaluate their coverage based on a lot more than just the rate. Another problem is that most health "insurance" isn't insurance at all, but rather is a mostly pre-paid discount health package. Best to have a good health savings plan backed up by actual health insurance with a very large deductible for when costs get up high. These are much more affordable and fit the concept of insurance better.
You mean where people die all the time awaiting things like dialysis and other commonly available treatments? US Health care problems are a result of government intrusion. The solution is not more intrusion.

uhhh-it does not conflate xml with java-it says that xml is a good way to make java dynamic-you can parse in xml and have it direct your runtime behavior, almost like you were in an interpreted environment.  In python, you don't need that, because you are already in an interpreted environment.  Therefore, someone who had figured out the correct way to work in java would be mistaken in their impulse to use xml in python.

That was amazing.
In general I'd agree, but I doubt *this* problem is the result of a government intrusion.  Sounds like an insurance company that refuses to live up to its contractual obligations.  That *is* a legitimate place for government intervention (and yes, a lawsuit is the appropriate response) - business can't function without a strong legal system to enforce contracts.

True, but I believe some critics point out the [US wealth distribution](http://faireconomy.org/research/wealth_charts.html), where the bottom 50% owns ~3% of the wealth, while the richest 1% owns ~33%.

One noticeable characteristic of capitalism is that there are a large number of people who gain sustenance by wages, selling their labor on a market. (In the real world, it turns out that about 20% of people are neither workers nor capitalists, but a third class of professionals/managers that has been variously called names like "the new class" or "the coordinator class," at least since Barbara Ehrenreich's book. Some claim that this third class ruled the Soviet Union, and serves power in the US. I mention this, as many of us are part of that fairly empowered class, and that gives us a different perspective than some factory worker.)

This is pretty interesting, as both LimeWire and LimeWire Pro are licensed under the GPL. The GPL allows free redistribution of the program in any form, as long as one offers to distribute the source with it, and I quote:

"You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange”

So, does the tie to GPL licensing allow it to be destributed for free?  It seems so.  Feel free to point out where my reasoning is flawed.  :)

Please, spare me your false indignation.  The speakers were true to the spirit and life of Coretta Scott King, and not a single person who knew her was offended.

You don't even know me. I was talking about political statements as a whole whether they came from the left or the right.

IMO, they don't have anything to do with her. Statements about racial equality? Definitely. But statements concerning whether or not WMDs existed in a country or not? What does that have to do with her?

But hey, turning someone's funeral into a place to make potshots at the president you don't agree with is lame. *That* is what dishonors everything she stood for.

Her funeral was supposed to be a place to remember her, not to continue on the same rhetoric that has been stated for 3 years now.

The only person with false indignation here is you. I'm not "indignant" about anything, I just think it was something that wasn't very respectful.

I just wonder what you would've thought if President Bush would've stood up at her funeral and used it as a platform to make a statement or two against abortion. Would you still be so adamant about the issue? Or would you be adamant against him for doing that?

Coretta Scott King was a well known anti-war activist.  The Atlantic Journal-Constitution has a fantastic obituary at http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/0131metkingobit.html

From that article: 

Coretta King served as a Women's Strike for Peace delegate to the 17-nation Disarmament Conference in Geneva in 1962, and spoke out against the Vietnam War before her husband did.

Mrs. King has said that her anti-war views were rooted in her religious beliefs and that she became an activist in college.

"It is my faith that first made me a good candidate for pacifism," she once said. "There were a number of young men who became conscientious objectors. We organized ourselves as students in support of them."

Another thing that could be used to address the "I already saw this exact page a few hours ago" problem would be a user-configurable option to hide all stories with a vote from the user viewing the page. Or perhaps a separate read-flag would be better.
But in the case of companies it is still only money, it can still be seen as a calculated risk.

wtf is this?  wat is there to see here?!?
US troops should not be in AFrica - it is colonialism
Americans should not be building schools in AFrica - Africans should do that.
I wouldn't say that the american health care system is "free market".  It is heavily government controlled and regulated.  I would call it a more government regulated monopoly.  Similar to many respects to the baby bells, than free market.
Actually, I believe that the "hot" page is already what you are suggesting here. While "new" shows just the new stuff without any filtering and "top" shows the stuff that got the best scores ever, "hot" ranks stories based on both score and recency.
That's quite close to what I would like to see here: a feature that would display "hot" stuff since one's last visit (maybe with some threshold to hide the stuff that was just "hot" during a few minutes).
Exactly.  Insurance companies get away with bad service and terms because regulation protects them from competition.  There should be loads of start-up insurance companies challenging these guys, but it's a lot harder to do that than it should be.

Regulation is just about always proposed by existing companies in any given industry.  They claim it's for "consumer protection", but they're really just protecting themselves.
Yes, but the point is that it would be nice to have a page where you get a little slider for controlling how much weight age has in the equation.

If you want to drink from a firehose, set it all the way to the left and see the equivalent of the "New" page. If you want a bunch of PG essays and other all-time favs, set it all the way to the right. Otherwise, just find a middle-ground that suits your usage pattern.

I can't believe they put the dyed liquid in their mouths!
USA is accounted for 25 % of world CO2 emmisions. Other developed countries together ( Europe, Australia ) are responsible for additional 25 % of CO2 emmisions. 

And according to widespread recognized theory of Environmental Kuznets inverted U curve emmisions do decline with per capita income. 

However main idea of article is that developing countries will reach turning point faster because diffusion od technology is faster with internet. So new technology will slow down global warming. I never said it will stop it.
The two posts above me are absolutely correct.  There is zero competition in the health care insurance market and it is due to government regulations.

The interesting thing is that those regulations are lobbied FOR by the existing insurance companies as, although they are a cost to existing companies (a cost they merely pass on to the consumer), they are insurmountable barriers to entry for new competitors.

It is axiomatic: "when the problem is the government the solution is not more government".
An incorporated company can have it's acticles of incorporation revoked. It's assets are seized by the state and auctioned off. It is in effect, the death penalty for corporations.

A corporation does not have the right to life. Some corporations should be killed more often.
I totally agree. Congress should stay out of this. There are a lot of doomsday scenarios floating around about how if we don't enforce network neutrality with regulation, the World As We Know It will end. Since there is clearly no problem right now, and there may never be, I don't think congress should intervene. Whatever legislation they come up with they will inevitably get wrong, or, it will be overly vague and we'll end up having judges who don't understand anything about technology deciding the future of the internet.

Furthermore, even Lessig admitted that most of these potential problems might be moot if there were a healthy, competitive ISP market instead the current duopoly. Rather than trying to patch the situation with more regulation, why don't we get at the root? Figure out what is making it so difficult for companies to enter the market, and fix THAT.
The problem is the USA. Every other 'modern', western society has state sponsored health care. I live in Ireland, and though the health system gets frequent complaints of not being efficent enough and waiting lists being to large, it'd be political suicide for a politician to suggest that it be abolished. Why do Americans put up with it?! Why don't they demand from their government that there be a state sponsored health system? This is a matter of life or death FFS! I jsut can't understand it...

My British aunt had a blockage in an artery in her neck.  It was causing her to go blind for increasing amounts of time (eventually up to 20 minutes).  The prognosis was total permanent blindness unless she was operated on immediately.

The soonest the National Health System could see her was in six months.

As a result, she went to a private doctor and was operated on immediately and with complete success.

Of course, this meant she had paid for the operation twice: once in the taxes she had paid all those years for a service that failed to deliver on its promises and again when she paid the private doctor.

Despite the troubles with the American health care system, people come from all over the world (including other western countries) to get care they cannot receive at home via their native socialist medicine programs.

"What I find more difficult to understand, though, is the restriction on speech and access to knowledge. A free country has nothing to fear from the truth."

Actually, it does.  "Truth" sounds noble and glorious and pure, but unrestricted access tom, say, everyone's medical history, and publication of the same, is not a good thing.

Indeed, there is a similar argument made about the State eavesdropping on its citizens.  "If you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear."  But it seems less appealing when the shoe is on the other foot.

The problem  is not that there are restrictions in place, but the type of restrictions, and the motivation for them. 


I think he said "restriction on speech and access to knowledge". knowledge, not someone's personal information.
"What if we do have people who commit terrible acts as part of their job, while, in private, they remain loving husbands, good parents and caring friends?"

Such as the executioners at federal prisons?  Many people consider what they do to be reprehensible; they themselves may even be inclined to think so, but manage to justify it as "duty".  Or perhaps they see it as "justice", which I expect may also be true for people who commit torture.


The underlying reason the telcos want to charge for QoS is so they can hit VoIP providers with tariffs to drive up their costs so the telcos can compete with the wonderfully low prices.

Off-topic, and an unpopular opinion around here, but:

&gt; We gave the Iraqis freedom, runs the argument, and they repaid us with roadside bombs

When Muslim extremists blow up a building, or a train, or a crowd of tourists, or burn down an embassy, they're "just a few extremists" who've "perverted" a "noble religion and culture."

But the Iraqis are all against us.  Never mind that 70% of the Iraqi population voted in the parliamentary elections, or that Iraqi insurgents and foreign jihadis now occasionally attack each other, or that Iraqi polls show  sizable majorities believe the country is better off now than under Saddam, or that the coalition is finally getting around to building enough power plants to satisfy demand -- which the former regime never did. 

Iraq doesn't get the benefit of the doubt.  We're losing -- stuck in a quagmire.  Roadside bombings definitely aren't the work of a few jilted extremists -- they certainly aren't being carried out by a cadre of professional intimidators built up over 30 years under Saddam, and who have more to (re)gain than six dozen virgins in the afterlife.

I wonder if a simple keyed encryption mechanism might be adequate. For example, Google encrypts your data with a key, encrypts the key with your password, and stores everything but your password on their servers. The password is only used to verify a hash and temporarily decrypt the key. The password and decrypted key are never stored persistently on the servers. Maybe that would be adequate to keep out the government?

Alternatively, they could leave the data totally encrypted on their servers and the index structure unencrypted (but the keys and values encrypted). That would make searching a bit less flexible, but it would mean decryption could be purely client-side. A bit safer from hackers that way, since then you can add client-side mechanisms such that even the password alone is not enough to decrpyt, you need a private key or suchlike.
Its not that I don't trust "any business with personsal information"... reddit.com can keep my ip address that's not a big deal.  Storing an entire domains email on the other hand is another matter.

While it's hard to say without reading their actual Science article, this summary seems to overly simplify the search for neural correlates of consciousness.  For example, just measuring how well the brain transmits stimulation from TMS wouldn't explain why some specific lesions lead to loss of consciousness while others do not.
Ha ha yah, tell me about it. Anytime the brain pauses during work, it's immediately either:
gmail
reddit
web comics

in that order. Though I must say, I've definately learned a lot reading reddit, and I do need to respond quickly to lots of important emails!

Web comics... maybe not so important...
Those give me vertigo.  Not a very good way to represent 3D for the majority of users I'd suspect.
As opposed to hosting your email on some random virtualhost provided by, originally, lord knows who?

No, it's better than that.

If you built the computers storing your email, then yes, that is considerably more private. I would like to suggest that that is and will remain a tiny, tiny portion of email users.

I know I'm a little OTT on this, but I get around the fat wallet issue by having a credit card sized piece of paper with a printout of all my loyalty card numbers.  I've never had a hotel question it when I quote a number from the paper instead of handing over a card, etc.

A little anally retentive and my wallet is still fatter than I like (haven't figured out how to quote a number at an ATM), but it has served me well.
well, I stand by what I said - I'd rather have debt than be dead. And I know if it were *my* dad, and a choice between having him and tons of debt or no debt and no dad -- well, that one seems pretty clear.

I'm not absolving the insurance company here, it's absolutely idiotic if the treatment could've saved his life - but would it have? The article doesn't say, and that's what got my spidey sense tingling. They never spoke specifically about his prognosis, about whether the denied treatment would've actually saved his life (or at least, lengthened and/or improved quality of life). Not to mention that a story like this is a massive PR killer for the firm - systematically denying coverage to a cancer patient is a great way to destroy your own business - so it doesn't make much sense if you want to continue to have customers that they hear you'll nickel and dime them on CANCER TREATMENT. The man and the doctors all spoke as if their hands were tied -- my point is that, if someone else seemed to give you essentially a death sentence, as this article suggests - well, wouldn't you try to find a way to beat the rap? Or would you just sit there, "holding a lot of anger in"?
this one has been posted before
Actually, the AMA does a fair amount of lobbying, itself. Take a look at http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.asp?order=A and see who's #11. I don't see any insurance lobbyists above them.
I don't think anarchy is a solution to better healthcare. The root problem is the greater lobbying power. In a free market, power inevitably coalesces and you end up with monopolies as a result. Basically a pure free market (where money equals power) is inherently unstable and this is why we have these monopolies and cartels. This is where government has a positive role, to be able to override this inequality of power (by regulation, tax breaks for startups etc) and better balance the interests of everybody. The reasons that most people are anti-government is because government is up for sale and their interests are not well represented in comparison to, say, tobacco lobbyists. But this is precisely a symptom of a weak government and an overpowerful market.
This is totally misleading. Private health care is a power more expensive that contributions to the NHS when you compare like for like. Also, your aunt will have been visiting a doctor all her life on the NHS and the NHS will have trained her private doctor and quite probably have built the hospital that the operation was performed in.

i think that prorastination can be thought in a different way. 
for eg. i procrastinate one of my duties but and do another one. yeah it is procrastination but it can work positively.
nice article detailing google future
This is very, very old...
One of the reasons for procrastinating, that they don't talk about, is just boredom.  Some pressing tasks may be too uninteresting for us to do, and we put it off.  This is avoidance due to boredeom, not fear of failure or success.
This is not very interesting.
"Trust People and They'll Surprise You".

NO, REALLY!?  I had no idea that there was any reason to have faith in people and humanity to do good things!

And anyone who contests the notion that people can do just fine without being told to is obviously looking for a job running someone else's life: manager, politician, CEO...
I predict the article linked to is going to generate a lot of negative comments as the implication is that, if you are not a libertarian, you are irrational.

Getting past that, I have long thought education needs to focus on "FOUR Rs": Reading , 'riting, 'rithmetic, and "rogic" (logic).  Everything else comes out of those four. (Actually, well written books about logic will allow the deduction of writing and arithmetic in a reasonably intelligent person).

I never cease to be amazed at the percentage of adults I meet who don't immediately and almost instinctively understand that the two premises of (1) "if A then B" and (2) "B exists" does NOT imply the conclusion "A exists".

How a person who cannot get that simple question right can get anything right in their lives I don't know.

[The Department of Defense's Directive on Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces on Active Duty](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d134410x.htm)

&gt;4.1.1.  A member on active duty may:
&gt;
&gt;4.1.1.1.  Register, vote, and express his or her personal opinion on political candidates and issues, **but not as a representative of the Armed Forces**.

These people not only explicitly spoke as representatives of the Armed Forces, they spoke as its highest military officers.

Apparently both chu and fnord123 think it is better to be socialist and blind than capitalistic and visioned (yes, I am being facetious).  I guess socialist health care is sort of like that joke where one person says "The food here is awful!" and the other replies "Yes, and the portions are so small too!".

Seriously, in America people have historically prefered freedom, with its attendent risks and opportunities, over subservience to a bureaucracy.

What's the matter with it?  If someone was very involved with politics in their life, why would it be inappropriate? 

FWIW, it is actually fairly common for speakers to make political statements at funerals of politicians.  Here's McCain at Goldwater's funeral politicizing:
http://mccain.senate.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=Newscenter.ViewPressRelease&amp;Content_id=992
If you look up GWB's speech at Reagan's funeral, it had some serious politicizing, and other speeches at Reagan's funeral were politically charged.

Would you prefer that people never make politically charged comments at funerals?  Do you think that at the funerals for soldiers who died in Iraq nobody should say something as politically controversial as that they died for a noble cause?  

Let's face it, the Republican/Conservative media reaction to King's (and Wellstone's) funeral was really just political spin.  Personally, I am far more offended by those who would criticize the funeral of a fighter for civil rights to try to gain a partisan edge through spin, a spin from partisans who ultimately promote an agenda working to undo what King and her husband spent their lives  fighting for. Far better that the eulogies say what King herself would have said, and better that they share the passion and inspiration that the deceased inspired, than blather out empty platitudes for fear of offending the hyper-sensitive.

First, in a free market power does not inevitably coalesce.  This is shown by the fact that in the unregulated portions of our economy companies come and go (witness what happened after the airlines were deregulated - dozens of airlines have come and gone, including some that were considered absolutely unassailable, like PanAm).

Second, if you are concerned about the coalescing of power, the ultimate form of that is the government where the unelected bureaucracy stays decade after decade unresponsive to any but their own interests.

As far as lobbying power is concerned, the problem is that a specific interest is willing to spend a lot of money in a focused effort to buy key politicians while the people have their own lives they need to attend to.  As a result, the forces representing the people never get as organized or influential as those of the specific interests.

Any government with power will use that power to represent the interests of the most powerful members of society.  This has been true throughout history regardless of the form of the government.

It has been observed that "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely".  That is never clearer than in a centralized government.

Totally off topic but I'm already here and writing...  I find it interesting that some people think the "liberal" counter-culture of the 60s is what has led to the socialism of today.

The slogan of the counter-culture was "power to the people" which is the antithesis of socialism where all power is put in the hands of the very few (this is why a strong government on the right is not meaningfully different than a strong government on the left -- in both cases it is implied, by necessity, that the people have no power -- power is a zero sum game, the government cannot gain power without the people losing it and society where the people have no power is always a totalitarian state).

The epitome of "flower power", Melanie (Safka), is a Libertarian -- http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/melanie.html

Anyone who opposes abuses of government power and supports personal freedom should be a libertarian.

The government cannot abuse power it doesn't have (including regulating small business into non-existence at the behest of large companies who handle regulation as just a cost of doing business).

...sorry for the ramble but I was on a roll!
Where do you get that this is "literally for fun?"  The video is presented totally without context as anti-contractor propaganda.  Several of the cars came way too close-- often, contractor vehicles carry a sign warning to maintain distance to prevent the contractors from being attacked by vehicle-borne suicide bombers.  In the third clip it looks like they may have taken fire.
That is a very interesting set of data and I modded you up.  As a result, I cannot say what is the force behind allowing insurance companies to routinely screw over doctors.

It remains a fact though that doctors routinely lose 30-40% of what they could collect to bogus claims denials.  This percentage is a combination of cost of claims that are never collected on and the cost of filing claims repeatedly.  The inefficiencies on the business side of medicine are stupendous.
The sad thing is that I was procrastinating by reading that article instead of studying.  Ah well, back to good ol' comforting minesweeper.

What is more offensive to you, publishing disrespectful cartoons or burning down an embassy? We can talk about how inappropriate or 'unacceptable' the cartoons were all day long, but the violent reaction to them is far worse and will only cause outsiders to view all Muslims as crazed fanatics who are unable to assimilate into modern societies. If something is offensive to you, then state your case why and how it offends you. This is rational. Burning down buildings and the like is irrational and detrimental to your own cause.

Massive unemployment comes from the lack of Keynesianism to pick up the labour force slack.

Massive increase in the GDP in the top 10% comes from the reduction in corporate taxes, reduction of income taxes, and so on. One would hope the money would trickle down, but it really trickles to the people who make most of the money in a business -the owners -aka the people who it's trickling from.

I was just addressing the costs that you referred to. If you're going to say that the NHS has wasted money or cannot keep its end of the bargain, you need to pay attention to your accounting. 

As it happens, regarding quality, the NHS is way superior to private health care in some areas such as dentistry and psychiatry and equal in others. However, this is not widely known outside the medical profession and you will see people paying a fortune for private care in the mistaken belief that they are 'getting the best'. Typically, they will be treated by NHS doctors in NHS facilities and their payment will simply enable them to jump the queue.
Ruby on Rails uses Prototype.
Fog Creek sounds like a really nice place to work.  Its just that I wouldn't ever want to work on any of the things they seem to be working on.  It doesn't really matter how much "free" stuff you get thrown at you, if you really are a "superstar" programmer, you probably have the brains to start your own company / work on your own stuff that actually interests you.
Even then, it's only better if you built the computers yourself *and* you keep them up to date with security patches and minor version upgrades.

"The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators"(c)Paul Graham
http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html
It's a Japanese TV show. Most of it is fake.
I think that most opponents of globalization fail to understand this simple concept.  Dollars that go out of the USA must eventually be used to buy US products or services.  US jobs are created to make those products and perform those services.

In my opinion, there are some very good reasons to limit globalization.  Damage to the economy is NOT one of them.  Increased trade and interdependence seems likely to help the economies of all involved nations.

As for farm subsidies for "national security", we have to decide on what counts as "national security".  Certainly protection from famine is included.  The risk of famine due to interruption of food imports is very small, in my opinion.  If corn production slows in the midwest and a war cuts corn imports, the nation will just have to eat rice grown in the south.  (Fat people would have to eat healthy rice instead of corn chips cookied in corn oil.)  If such a situation occurred, I bet it would take very little time for the US to regain sufficient corn production.  The States is so big, with so many natural resources, that this argument applies to every imported product - even oil.  If oil imports were cut off, the nation would survive on oil from Texas, Alaska, and the Gulf.  It wouldn't take long before *everything* was running on propane and hydrogen.  A recession might occur, but does that count as a "national security" situation?  Is the health of the nation's economy to be considered as part of the nation's security?  I don't know.

What it actually boils down to is, when push came to shove, NHS failed my aunt.  They knew what needed to be done and when it needed to be done but were willing to let her go blind for the rest of her life because she didn't fit into some bureaucrat's "five year plan".  It had nothing to do with getting the best, it had to do with getting emergency treatment that was otherwise unavailable.

It also failed my grandmother who had to spend her last days in a private facility due to the atrocious care she received under the NHS (too many patients, not enough nurses and doctors).

There is very little incentive under socialist medicine for a person to dedicate themselves to the years of advanced education to become a doctor.  As a result, there is a chronic shortage of good doctors in the NHS.

When all the accounting is looked at (i.e., quality of patient care), NHS is a failure.  As a rule, people go from the UK to the US for care but they do not go from the US to the UK for care.  Top doctors leave the UK and practice in the US but not the reverse.

As for British dentistry, it is legendarily bad.  For example, Austin Power's teeth are part of the overall joke.
Paul Graham's talking about something else:

"There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you do instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing, (b) something less important, or (c) something more important. That last type, I'd argue, is good procrastination.

.....................

That's the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all procrastinators. They're type-C procrastinators: they put off working on small stuff to work on big stuff."


THIS article is more about "type-A" "type-B". 
(just disambiguating)
I am a procrastinator. Combine this with the fact that I have this unexplainable fear of talking to unknown people and strong urge to flee from uncomfortable situations, I keep on putting off making work related phone calls... not good.

Yeah, the 10 things to know sure didn't seem to include anything helpful to get us procrastinators moving in the "right" direction.  There is one exception; it says:

"Procrastinators can change their behavior—but doing so consumes a lot of psychic energy. And it doesn't necessarily mean one feels transformed internally. It can be done with highly structured cognitive behavioral therapy." 

...damn that doesn't too fun.  Sounds like something I'd be likely to put off for a while, actually.
Your theory does not explain why these shootings were assembled in such a video collage, it does not explain the choice for the soundtrack - it is not an educational video at all, there is no commentary. And, in most cases, the cars following behind in fact did not get close at all, certainly not close enough to read any warnings. 

And, lastly, even if cars would've come too close (they didn't), it is a public road, and by no means are contractors are allowed to shoot and kill people for doing that. They were clearly not at a security check-point, and they did not issue any warnings to the effect either.

Skeptical? If you are skeptical in nature you should be doubting peak oil - it is the suddenly boosted into the mainstream by just journalists, spouting lots of dubious statistics without a solid proof, etcetera.

The article itself is a pretty good one. The only thing it fails to mention is that peak oil is so far still a theory and by no means a certainty.  But this is good in a way: Even if you take peak oil as gospel, this article explains that it won't be the next TEOTWAWKI. Comparing peak oil to y2k is a good comparison, too.
I'll read this article later

I think it depends on which country you are from.  In South-Africa you will rarely have cards from different banks as  no one bank will give you that big an advantage over the others and they in general disapprove of you having accounts with the competition.

I solve the problem by only carrying the absolute critical cards with me, and the ones I know I will need on that day.  The rest are safely locked up at home.  So the most is probably 1 credit card and 1 medical card.  Most of them time I carry only cash and only what I need, since the best money management is not to have money with you when you feel that itch to buy something you don't really need.

Such broad reflections from a person who's only visited *one* modern city in all of China?
I agree that insurance companies are a big problem, but on the other hand, why are medical costs so high?  

Why must doctor's (and lawyers) be paid so lucratively? Is it because their impact on whether you die is so prominent?

What about the mechanic that services your car? If he makes a mistake you could die too. What about the engineer that designs your shopping mall or the train you take every day?

Traditionally governments have built corporations where private involvement doesn't makes sense (more applicable outside US).  Power companies, telco's, road infrastructure, etc, usually start out as state owned.  This usually works if government remains free and without corruption.

Many doctor's know are doctors because of the money and only that, up to the point where they don't want to treat patients without seeing the money first.  I say, cut these guys down to size so that only those with a real passion for helping people remain.  Do this by lowering their incomes to be similar to other skilled people.  This will reduce costs a lot.
Did he even read the peak oil website he was referred to? While I don't agree with everything on there, all of his arguments [since they are the first ones everybody thinks of when they hear about peak oil] are already countered there.

I still have some hope it won't be a big issue, but this just-leave-it-to-market-forces argument is bunk - if/when the world's consumption exceeds oil production capacity and if the futures market then causes the price to spike and market-forces to swing into action, it's already too late to economically scale up the alternative sources that just became commercially viable (and their infrastructure) because the price of oil just spiked - and with it the price of manufacturing and construction. 

Having journalists make this a scary issue that everybody is aware of (like Y2k) might allow the market to solve it - if enough people are seeing the problem coming, and do things such as banking on the spike (or whatever they think is going to happen) then the market can act pre-emptively instead of reacting afterwards when it's too late to fix. Mass hysteria will solve this problem :)

Even the picture he paints is still bad - we'll switch to alternative energy sources because while they cost too much to switch to now, oil will soon cost more... goody, clearly it's going to be a non-event like y2k then.
My low-tech solution to the 'fat wallet syndrome':  I got [one of these](http://www.thejimi.com/index.php) and put only my driver's license, debit card, and a few bills inside.
I lost a lot of skepticism when despite all assurances of plenty coming from Saudi Arabia etc, we see that when a hurricane takes a few oil platforms offline, America (and the EU) has to dip into the strategic reserve to avoid oil shocks because _the entire world_ no longer has the capacity to cover them.

y2k, as a problem, isn't even remotely similiar to peak oil.
It's always great to learn these useful tips from a doctor.  Or some guy who says he read it in a Field and Stream in a waiting room, which is basically the same thing.
Good article; Engber avoided the histrionics of recent MSM news over the Mohammed cartoon flap by (!) consulting the primary sources and consulting a range of actual living, breathing, representatives of the various religious viewpoints he covered to get his facts straight.

If only the MSM would do the same.
This was a news story about 2 months ago.
Quoted:
“ As oil gets more expensive, other technologies will compete on price and replace oil. …there are so many new options that become available as oil prices rise that we will simply replace oil with all of these other technologies ”

I don’t believe that Peak Oil will be the end of our civilization but to say that $100+ a barrel is a non-event is just plain wrong in my opinion. I fail to see the logic that says that buying alternative energy for a much higher price will make Peak Oil a non-event. The main problem is not that we will totally run out of energy, the problem is that alternative sources of energy will come at a much higher cost. 

Also the author fails to mention the main hypothesis about Peak Oil theory; that the peak may come much sooner than we think. If the production peak will come in 15 years maybe it will be close to a non-event. But what if, as some people believes, the peak has already been passed? Still a non-event?

The best commentary I've read over this subject. My view on the subject is: freedom of expression must have no restrictions. When someone crosses (from some other's point of view) some kind of border it's just a matter of HIS personal taste and you may agree or disagree but you're not allowed to start a chain reaction like the one these CRIMINALS  supposed-to-be-muslims started.
My guess would be...prison.
That essay was condescending and sloppy, and as such, extremely irritating. It sets up an analogy between reasoning about computation and reasoning about political life.  The falsehood of this analogy is so obvious that only an idiot would propose it: as Einstein said, "As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."  The theory of computation is a hell of a lot simpler and better posed than even very basic political issues, and so reasonable people can agree on the correct answer to many computational problems.  That is not at all true of politics, even among libertarians, despite the author's provincial claim to the contrary.

He makes a guess in the essay as to why libertarians are sometimes seen as arrogant.  Perhaps the real reason he himself often comes across as arrogant is that only an arrogant fool could think he can reliably predict the effects of social policy and reason objectively about the desirability of those effects.
I mostly agree with the author - substitutes in consumption and production will mean that we switch away from the most costly to produce, and switch into those commodities that give us most benefit.

Where I disagree with the author is his notion that you can just put a tax on the commodity to speed up the process.  While the transition may be sped up, it isn't really sensible to add costs to the economy for no real purpose.  We all suffer.

There is nothing inherently wrong with oil as a source of energy.

Uh...try being a medical student paying at least 200,000 dollars in education.  And that is just medical school.  Don't forget the money that one has to pay for undergraduate education to get into medical school.  And then there's the at least 3 years of residency where you are making around 40,000 dollars a year, meanwhile loan companies are on your ass because you've graduated.  The interest piles up.  That is over 10 years in education where there really is no pay.  Unless your family is independently wealthy, would-be doctors have to give up a lot to become doctors.
*Many concepts, such as the one-child policy, are outrageous or offensive to Western sensibilities, but they are widely supported and well regarded here. And frankly, they make a certain amount of sense. [...] In practical terms, the West will likely end up adopting similar policies.*

I stopped reading there; there's no way that I can take such statements seriously or with a straight face while every reliable indicator tells me that the West, especially Europe and the U.S., are facing rapidly declining birthrates which will soon affect the ability of those countries to retain a strong economic presence in science, technology, and a host of other industries (if they haven't already, and I'm convinced they have).  Is Mr. Shuttleworth aware of how the birthrate of a country like, say, Germany affects its GNP?

So to hear some guy blab about the West needing population control based on a visit to China strikes me as not only ironic, but ridiculous.
I have to take exception [sic] with advice #7, which says that coding standards are not important.  The author obviously never worked in teams where there were more than 3 coders, or where there were a few people who insisted on doing things their own way, to the detriment of others who voluntarily play by the rules.  Here's a concrete example,

Let's say you like to indent 2 characters per tab stop.  The safe way to do this is to set your editor so that a TAB key press never inserts the TAB ASC character 9, but rather just moves over 2 columns and inserts spaces in their place.  Now if programmer foo comes along and configures his editor so that the tab character 9 is interpreted as movin 2 columns over instead of the default 8, then the file will be unreadable to you, the original editor.

Imagine this interleaved throughout a thousand line source file across hundreds of files.

At the end of the day, why is coding standard important?  It's so that if 20 people have to look over the same code base, they don't have to waste an extraordinary amount of time trying to reformat code in their head.

And don't get me started on the author's comment about not commenting your code.  If you've ever had to maintain a million lines of code over a 5+ year period, you'd instantly know that overcommenting is a life saver, even (especially) if you are the sole author of those a million lines.

This essay is from 1992; honestly, the character of the net has changed a lot since then.  There WAS a lot of libertarian discussion on the usenet at the time, enough so that if you were an alien who came to earth and read only USENET, you might have thought libertarians were the dominant political party.  I do not think that is the case anymore.

What the author didn't consider is that back in 1992, the net was very attractive to niche communities.  The phrase "the long tail" was 10 years away from being coined, but people were discovering the effects of it even back then.

If you were a republican or democrat in 1992, there was no reason you had to get on something as crude as the 1992 internet: there were communities that existed for you in real life.  

On the other hand, if you were a libertarian in 1992, one of the few places a "libertarian" community existed was the internet.  And the trend fed itself; once you got on the internet and found someone who agreed with your political views, you probably talked politics A LOT, making others with similar views more likely to join the discussion, etc.

There may have been a seeming correlation between programmers and libertarians at the time, but that's only because there was almost nobody on the internet BUT programmers.  I could have found a correlation between almost any "weird sex fetish" and "programmers" at the time, too, but once again, that's because of the ability of the internet to cater to out-of-the-mainstream communities, and does not imply any actual causality.

&gt; What it actually boils down to is, when push came to shove, NHS failed my aunt.

Presumably she had been using the NHS all her life - did she not get what she paid for then? There are failures in any system, however well run. Your anecdote is a good talking point and clearly a disgraceful failure of the NHS. However, you are extrapolating all kinds of incorrect stuff from it. I have a relative who's career was advising people who had complaints about the NHS. Her agency was run as a completely independent entity and could only have been funded by government. She will now never use private care as a result of what she learnt. 

&gt; They knew what needed to be done and when it needed to be done but were willing to let her go blind for the rest of her life because she didn't fit into some bureaucrat's "five year plan".

A waiting list is not the same as a five year plan - comments like this are indicative of a fantasy outlook. Ironically, the main problem in the NHS is the attempt at imposition of some kind of free market principles. This has meant resources are being diverted to unneccesary layers of management on the ideologically-based assumption that the NHS was innefficient from top to bottom and needed sorting out by management professionals. We just had a story on reddit about the huge efficiency of self-organising objective-based teams - this had been going on in the NHS for decades.

&gt; There is very little incentive under socialist medicine for a person to dedicate themselves to the years of advanced education to become a doctor. As a result, there is a chronic shortage of good doctors in the NHS.

You don't understand the UK health system. All doctors are trained by the NHS. The shortage is due to those doctors then going into private practise or abroad, not due to a lack of people becoming doctors. 

&gt; Top doctors leave the UK and practice in the US but not the reverse.

Because they get paid more - private healthcare _is_ way more expensive.

&gt; As a rule, people go from the UK to the US for care but they do not go from the US to the UK for care.

I know personally of people travelling from the US to use NHS facilities because they were far superior. Less slick, but much better care. There are some operations and treatments which aren't available in the UK which people have to travel for and these rightly get huge publicity. 

&gt; As for British dentistry, it is legendarily bad. For example, Austin Power's teeth are part of the overall joke.

Strange then that the private dentists are NHS trained. The Austin Powers joke: the UK is not known for dental _cosmetics_ such as straightening and whitening (which is actually a sign of poor dental health). (There was also a problem with over-fluoridisation in the UK water post-war which led to a number of people with gnarly but extremely strong teeth that never needed a dentist).

"I have to take exception [sic] with advice #7, which says that coding standards are not important. "

I think his point was that anal-rententive obsessing over code standards was bad.   "Close enough" is often good enough to allow people to get on with productive work.


Right, the coding standards "tip" was the only one that I really disagreed with.  It's not so much the added recognition  load as the added *recall* load.  If there's no coding standard, you have to stop and remember whether that variable ought to be headerCount or HeaderCount or headerCnt or cHdr.  I've found that developing a consistent naming convention and common vocabulary is perhaps the biggest factor in the success of large projects.

Things like brace-placement and indent-level aren't as important to me, as I can usually read just about any coding style in common usage, and it's usually fixable with a menu item in the IDE anyway.  Mixing tabs &amp; spaces is a huge pain, but also fixable by the IDE.  It's really the naming conventions that can cause huge problems.

The author's comment about comments should be read as a code smell, not an absolute prohibition.  Whenever you see a comment, ask yourself if you could've extracted the code into a method or named your variables better.  If a comment dictates something that should not occur, use an assertion to make sure it *doesn't* occur.  There are some comments that really *shouldn't* be removed; "why" comments are the most obvious ones, and probably the ones I find most helpful when navigating a large codebase.  A well-placed "where" comment is helpful if the flow of control isn't obvious, but again, you should ask yourself how to refactor the program so the flow of control *is* obvious.  

Commenting is duplication of information, and like most instances of duplication, one or both copies usually lies.  That's more dangerous than not commenting at all, because it can blind you to what the code is really doing.
I wonder if this works in the morning, like when you get up after too few hours of sleep.
This is very sad
Funny college essay written by Hugh Gallagher, author of Teeth.
my huge list of links
this guy is an idiot... when we switch from diesel and gasoline to biodiesel what does he think will grow the massive soybean crops we will need to sustain our economies. You'd need a hell of alot of fertiliser.... and whats fertiliser made of? oh right... its a by-product of oil.
Perhaps reposting it with the right link would help. This link goes directly to the blog, not the one article alone.

Yeah, funny. "It has been over a decade since Microsoft rocked the PC world with the release of its revolutionary Windows 95 operating system." :-)

&gt; in a free market power does not inevitably coalesce. 

Actually, I was recently told by an academic that there was a mathematical proof of this. Guess I need to get more info on that, but I'd say it was clearly evidenced by monopolies and cartels - particularly in societies where money talks the most.

&gt; This is shown by the fact that in the unregulated portions of our economy companies come and go 

But do major shareholders come and go? I think it's obvious and fundamental that the kind of volatility you are talking about can be mapped to the size of the company (trends, not exceptions prove the rule in this case).

&gt; (witness what happened after the airlines were deregulated - dozens of airlines have come and gone, including some that were considered absolutely unassailable, like PanAm).

The airline sector was particularly volatile and you would obviously get shifts of power following changes in the regulatory regime. (update: US are now investigating airlines for evidence of cartels see http://reddit.com/info?id=1yp1)

As for the rest of your post, I don't want to get into libertarianism here (I think it's no more than an expression of utter selfishness for the record) but I would say that your statements seem to be based on a false premise that the state and its occupants are two diametrically opposed forces.
I think you missed the point of what he was trying to say.  The author was *not* suggesting that we switch to soybeans, but that it was *one* of many options available.

One thing that the author did not mention was the consumer side of the equation: as prices go up, humans will curtail their consumption of the resource.  We see that today with people buying more fuel efficient cars.  The Hummer is dead.
Awesome.

Does anybody have any idea how this works, or how someone came up with it?
Utter quackery.
the article doesn't really talk about ways to help solve the problem - it's like going to the doctor to find out what's wrong, but not how to fix it. Thumbs down!
He isn't bitching, he's pointing out an extremely important point: Google has disarmed Microsoft's FUD tactics. If you ran a startup in the 1990s, Microsoft would be your primary fear. Now, your problems focus merely on getting noticed.
But the reddit title could add value instead of just parroting bad choices by other editors.

The title of this Reddit submission is very misleading. Not really surprising, considering [this](http://reddit.com/user/rnichols/submitted). Come on, man - it's alright to take a side, but it's not alright to twist things in favour of your side.

Oh, just to clarify: I do agree that it's crap that she's being punished so much for that minor incident. It's just the headline I take issue with ("meek", "simple peaceful"). Heck, it doesn't even help our side - it obscures the real issue, which is that the punishment is too extreme.

But google isn't in the business of making products that only appeal to idiots, so I think it's unlikely that they will do this.
The contractors clearly discriminate between approaching vehicles and cars pulling right up alongside; they only fire upon the former. Your argument for "keeping a distance from potential suicide bombers" falls apart right there--one would expect a certain envelope on all sides for relative traffic. These motorists were shot at, and potentially hurt or killed, for virtually no reason.

These guys are basically living out Grand Theft Auto in a no-consequence zone. Pointless.
Close up, we read a person's face by the the finer parts of his features.  From afar, however, we must rely on more macroscopic shading.  These pictures, I think, have one face's finer features superimposed on a blur of the other's shading.
The article describes her as meek so I think it's fair play for the headline to reflect the content. Also I think the real issue is not that the punishment is too extreme, but that she shouldn't have been arrested in the first place and that her right to free speech was violated - that's what she is suing for in any case.
good for her. the world would be a better place if there were more like here.
The API as such seems to be ok (we are using it in Fold); could be an authorization problem.
I have heard of many more people going from the UK to US or even to India for their health care than anyone going to the UK.  How is the NHS far superior?  I myself would never leave my life in the hands of the NHS.  Not all doctors are trained by the NHS, you neglect to point out the doctors from India and Pakistan who have to pass exams such as the PLAB.  The US and the UK systems are very different.  For instance, the attitudes towards physicians are very different.  In the US, second opinions are commonplace, whereas in the UK, it is very rare because the doctor is always right.  Having socialized medicine is all fine and good when you are healthy, but give it a go when you develop cancer or some other pathology.
Evolution and faith: a false dichotomy.

Indeed.
Disagreement does not constitute a criminal act in a free country.

At worst, she should have been allowed to wait for the shuttles in an area outside of earshot. Asking her to leave at an unreasonable time, creating a threat of criminality via trespassing laws, is just thick-headed behavior. Wouldn't expect any less from the creators of "free speech zones".
what does authorization has to do with methods?
Do you mean that both libertarians and programmers are more likely to be young than old?  That's possible.
Yeah, try installing and uninstalling an X-based IM with tons of library dependencies on \*nix 900 times. I'll bet your package configuration and dotfiles (to say nothing of libraries) are going to be a bit confused by the end, *if* you finish the ordeal within your lifetime. =P

Nice "rogical" response.

Your points are:

- I didn't like this essay's style
- This essay is so obviously wrong that if you don't agree you're an idiot (or not reasonable)
- An out-of-context quote with no analysis used solely for the authoritative weight of the name "Einstein"
- An attack on the author's character


Isn't it ironic that the substance of this article is far better confirmed by your unwitting rebutal than likely any positive response listed here?

It has to do with how your brain processes images.
There are two faces, one normal and one with a grin. The left hand pic consists of a blurred normal face superimposed on the angry face. The right hand pic is the opposite (blurred grin + normal face). The blurry images on each side are mainly low frequency in nature, while the non-blurred images consist of higher frequency components.

Simply put, you can say that the pictures are beeing low-pass filtered when you step back a few feet (or just squinting your eyes is enough). Therefore when you squint, the picture to left has its high frequencey components filtered out (the grin) and the low frequency components are therefore more pronounced - and you see the normal face. And in the right pic you low-pass filter out the normal face when you squint, so the angry face is more pronounced.

Serious camel toe there.
Here's the original paper:
http://cvcl.mit.edu/Papers/Schyns-Oliva99.pdf
It will be interesting to see if the Americans with Disabilities Act is applied all websites.  If so, that will have interesting repercussions for web development: To make complicated sites accessible to the blind, you need to work with the makers of screen reader software, who charge developers quite a bit of money, and who are very slow to support new standards.

I actually think that properly incentivised markets are about the only thing that can manage the transition from oil to whatever.  After all, a transition from one sort of fuel to another, if it is solveable at all, is a massive resource-allocation problem, and markets have proven to be unbeatable at those.  So I think it would be pretty good, right now, if a rather aggressive tax was levied on imported crude, and things that are made of/with crude oil.  In the absence of such a tax, I think we are in for a rough transition.
The guy was 78...
Agreed.  Plus, if more farmland is being used to grow "energy", then less farmland is available to grow food.

Y2k was a man-made computer problem.  Peak oil is about a limited, finite, natural resource.  Once someone even mentions y2k as being a similar problem to peak oil, they prove themselves to be clueless idiots.
What part of 'private event' is confusing?

I agree that the punishment is out of line with the offense.  She should have simply been asked to leave, but there are no free speech issues here.  There is no right to speak at a private event.

That being said, I don't think much of  'private political rallies'.  It isn't difficult to preach to the choir.
Me too.
Tried it, iTunes is still better and faster, but I will check out the future versions
The comments on the site itself criticize it fairly well.  I'll skip the bogus comparison to Y2K, and just name some of the problems he overlooks.
Oil is used for lots of things other than energy (e.g. plastics)
Oil packs lots of energy in a stable transportable form, moreso than any of the non-fossil fuel alternatives.
The entire world's infrastructure is centered around oil. Changing to something else will take time, money, and *energy*.
The developing world is gobbling up pretty much every kind of resource, so prices on everything (and relatedly the energy required to get them) are rising.
So, yes, there are alternatives, and yes, we can get better at conservation (compare European cars' fuel efficiency to American), and we can get better at extraction, which all should buffer things somewhat. But a real danger is there, as seen by the economic consequences of the oil shortages in the 70s, and the post-Katrina problems. I don't see a collapse, but I do see some unpleasantness, which could be reduced with foresight.
They should have had some consideration for the rain and distance it would take for her to leave peacefully. The proper thing to do, if they absolutely wanted to kick her out, would have been to offer to drive her back.
Y2k had to do with dates on computer programs.  To fix it, programmers spent months adding an extra digit to all their programs.  

We cannot flip a switch and force the earth to manufacture in a few years a substance that took the earth millions of years to create.
Yeah, I saw that [Aegis message board](http://www.aegisiraq.co.uk/Message_Board.htm) as well. They seemed to accept that this was done by one of their own. But they also didn't seem to be ashamed of it either.

Whether that's because it was all according to procedure (such as it was), or whether they were evil bastards, I don't know.

ALL bush and cheney rallies are "private events", ESPECIALLY if they are filmed or photographed.  They don't want visible dissenters.

If you visited my home, and you verbally disagreed with something, should you be arrested merely for disagreeing?  After all, that would be a private event as well.

Hunters: Torturing and killing animals for fun.
Comparing peak oil to y2k is as dumb as it gets. For one thing there is no economic incentive to hype “peak oil” as it was from the IT-consultants towards y2k.
Obviously authorization has to do with what methods *return*, which seemed to be the submitter's problem.
Hey, I'm gonna start firing on tailgators, hope that's ok with you.  They might hurt me, you know, and I'm soooo afraid!
I think throwaway is a libertarian in disguise playing devil's advocate :)

Don't forget the premise that "only an arrogant fool could think he can reliably predict the effects of social policy".  If this is true, then then how can we possibly trust anyone to have control over society?  Any politician must certainly be an arrogant fool.

The premise is false.  Of course, that doesn't mean that politicians are NOT arrogant fools.  It simply means that anyone who predicts the effects of social policy is not necessarily an arrogant fool -- foolishness is ignoring reason when making your predictions.  Many great scientists were considered arrogant fools before their ideas came to be widely accepted as correct, even ideas that seem obvious now.
Sorry, don't mean to insult anyone.  Educate yourself!

Several points:

-getting logic into education is a great idea.

-deducing arithmetic from simpler stuff is hard as hell, unless you favor handwaving.  This is why it is so rarely done-Russel and Whitehead derived arithmetic from set theory, and I am not aware of anyone else doing something analogous.  Feynman derived all of algebra, and the basis of trig and geometry, from the counting numbers, zero, and the successor function, but that is nothing like deriving arithmetic from logic.

-I'm not even sure what you mean by deriving writing from logic, but whatever you meant, it is almost certainly more wrong than deriving arithmetic from logic.  You obviously cannot derive a particular natural language, and if there are universal principles of effective writing, I doubt that you can derive those either.  

-therefore, you greatly overestimate the domain of applicability of logic.

-Most of life is not amenable to analysis by syllogism, so being bad at syllogisms is not so much of a handicap.  So while it is bad logic to assume from the fact that your spouse's car is in the driveway that your spouse is in the house, it is a pretty good guess.

Further, many people seem to get along just fine without understanding the conservation of mass, evolution, and a bunch of other things that I would call pretty fundamental. It is strange that this is the case, I think.
If you shoot somebody while hunting, you should automatically lose your hunting licence, and probably go to jail. There's no excuse for not following basic [gun safety rules](http://www.nrahq.org/education/guide.asp); you should always know what you're shooting at and what is in front/behind/around it.
Interesting. I actually had my intro to CS class with Stuart. He was a really good teacher, but I found some of his personal views, well, out there. Which is, of course, irrelevant.
I think what I see as the primary fallacy in his argument is equating behaviour of a computer program with that of a society. If the godlike predictive ability that apparently all libertarians have were available to public policy members, the world would be a much better place.
I'll try to state this somewhat diplomatically: I wouldn't be surprised to learn that there is are a disproportional number of libertarians amongst programmers, because (in experience) both tend to be priviledged white males with little international experience. (And I say that as one myself, albeit well travelled). To grossly oversimplify, my impression of their thinking seems to be: "Hey, I work hard, but that big bad government takes some of my money and gives it to those lazy welfare moms. Let's get rid of government! We can do it ourselves."
There are a lot of problems with this. If you travel the world, especially to some rougher areas, you'll see this isn't too happy. The people with power take more, and screw over the rest. The problem is, pure economic efficiency (even if you could achieve while being so ignorant as to think all people act a fully informed rational agents) is not the only goal. There are also minimumal quality of life guarantees and other restrictions (i.e. pollution). To look at his minimum wage argument, does this mean we should be allowing (to exaggerate a bit) eleven year-olds to work in unsafe mines? They're cheap! Regulations are only "the government interference that made those people so poor in the first place."
Don't get me wrong -- I think capitalism tends to bring the highest quality of life to the most people, in comparison to other systems the world has seen. But it has to be capitalism with oversight.

Whatever. Interesting discussion on computing, but the libertarianism angle didn't seem to say much more than "why do people dismiss us as arrogant just because we say we know how to solve all the world's problems?"
If that headline didn't mislead you, then perhaps your brain works a little differently than mine. I pictured something like this:

"Hello, madam. Do you like President Bush?"

*meekly* "No..."

"ARREST THAT WOMAN!!!"

The headline misled me, and therefore it is misleading to me, at least. Perhaps it is not as misleading to others.

I agree with your second paragraph; it echoes what I said above.

With respect to rnichols, I wanted to draw attention to the fact that he has mostly submitted political stories. If you read that other story on Reddit about the minds of highly political people, you might understand why that fact might fit into my rant about the untruthful headline.

"may or may not be critical of Bush" - Come now. I do not believe we inhabit two separate realities each with distinct rules, which would be the only way to explain you actually believing that. ;-)
it's kinda disturbing that this guy doesn't say anything about the context he's working in.  obviously, u need different practices for different situations.  sometimes over-commenting is good - sometimes it's bad.  it depends on the size of your team, the ppl on it, the scope of the project, etc. etc.  but i find most of these "how to be teh best programm0r te4m evar!!" don't give any context whatsoever.  even mr. on software does this!

Well... Yes and no. Problems with the OS are not related to those regular tasks, and the regular users couldn't care less about problems when they appear, they just want to see them gone, and that's usually harder in linux.

Linux is not yet a windows-replacer. If it were it should be as easy to handle - yet I've spent a *lot* more time making linux thing work and linux problems go away. In windows things tend to be either more automatic, or much more hopeless. At least that's *clearer*...

Could you give me some specific examples of inventions developed by muslims?  Not trying to be snarky at all, it's just that I have heard by several different sources that muslims have never invented anything, and for the last two thousand years they've been at constant war.

I thought it was the greeks who developed all those things you talked about.  You know, Aristotle, Galileo, Copernicus?

Methinks you're mistaken, actually.
Answer to the critics who say he should go.
Meh, the {firefox,linux}x{no virus,no adware} arguments are somewhat moot. When they represent a large enough market share they will be targeted, and while they are a little more secure, things will be found, period. ...and I'm sure I'm not the only one too lazy to only su/sudo when I need to:) (I love ubuntu's view on that, actually)


And XP rarely needs to reboot anymore, less so than 2000, I believe. I believe install programs are often just lazy or playing safe when they say they want to, though yes, kernel hooks seem to still require reboot. Drivers rarely at all - and if you're talking about hardware, unless you compiled *everything* as kernel modules  then yes, you certainly need to reboot linux.


I couldn't really live without my linux server *pokes with toe* but that's the headless one right now, slave to my windows box. It's just more convenient right now, if for ever fewer reasons.
I can imagine a scenario where intersecting, seperate groups of hunters following safe procedures could end up in an accident (though it should still be a rarity). But when one small group of hunters shoots one of their own, somebody's being stupid. 

As someone who hunted as a kid and then learned tactical military maneuvers as an adult, be assured that what old Dick did was completely avoidable. The late night talk show hosts are gonna have a field day.
This is going to sound absolutely horrible, . . . but so what?  Who cares what they've translated, what have they invented?
I sort of pity any country whose leaders still engage in bird hunting.

Says a lot about the current US administration: a hunter VP coupled with a farmer from Texas.
You've got to be really dumb in the head to lift your skirt and not realize your damn coot is showing.... And yet the media is obsessed with this person... :confused:
I am beginning to hate religious fundamentalists.  They are wholly without logic, commonsense, or compassion.
I'm sure the government will soon "confirm" his Al-qaeda links.......

Why is it that the vice president is at fault here?

Perhaps his hunting buddy shouldn't have walked up behind him unannounced when he should know that it is standard practice for quail hunters to swing their shotguns around, tracking birds as they're flushed out, discharging ordinance which has a wide dispersal pattern?

When you're shooting at birds, it's not like you're in a blind focusing on a stationary target with plenty of time to examine every object between you and it.
I'd like to see this cross reported in the Japanese media:

"Foreigners are gullible enough to believe our 'reality' shows are real*!* Film at 11."
Summary: She interrupted Cheney's speech by saying "No no no no". She was asked to leave or otherwise face being arrested. She refused to leave. Thus, she was arrested.

I don't particularly feel sorry for her. She was given a choice. Although it does say a lot about Cheney's (lack of) commitment to freedom of speech.
So, is he going to be charged?  Can I shoot a hunter and not be charged?
If I shoot a hunter by accident, will I also not be charged?

I heard on CNN that the elderly man he shot returned to the hunting group after shooting a bird and failed to announce his presence.  Apparently Cheney mistook him for the fabled Giant Bald Turkey rumored to roam the forrests of Texas.

Or maybe this is phase two of Bush's new Medicare reform bill.
I envy her bragging rights.
Not if the victim was partially at fault, doesn't press charges, and was only lightly injured because your gun was full of birdshot.

Of course, Cheney's daemonic aura and flesh-eating Halliburton lawyer zombies would allow him to get away with human sacrifice in Times Square, but here it's overkill.
Its really not his fault at all. For those who aren't reading the article and are making presumptions based off the title of this, here you go:

&gt; Armstrong said she was watching from a car while Cheney, Whittington and another hunter got out of the vehicle to shoot at a covey of quail.
Whittington shot a bird and went to look for it in the tall grass, while Cheney and the third hunter walked to another spot and discovered a second covey.
Whittington "came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter and didn't signal them or indicate to them or announce himself," Armstrong said.
"The vice president didn't see him," she continued. "The covey flushed and the vice president picked out a bird and was following it and shot. And by god, Harry was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty good."
Non-sappy stuff and you guys still vote it down? Yeesh:)
Republican spin.  We want to hear the *real* story.  The one where he's guilty of something.
You'd think that Dick Cheney, of all people, would shoot to kill.
Not quite.  She was brought in by shuttle (required).  The choice was for the 55 year old woman to walk over a mile (in the rain) OR to be arrested.

That's not a great selection of choices.
Not that it matters, but I'm a registered Republican, and have voted for most Republican presidential candidates (but not Bush)
How are Bush/Cheney events different from other political rallies?  Plenty of pro-Bush folks are fanatical enough to try and crash Democrats' rallies.  Why do we never see or hear them succeed?

And although I'm not a lawyer, I'm pretty sure that if you own a piece of property, you can throw non-owners off it if that's what you want to do.

I remember hearing a story on NPR's *This American Life* about a kid from San Francisco who (improbably) got a pass to attend one of Bush I's press briefings, then jumped up on his chair and started screaming at the top of his lungs to "protest" something.  Bush called off his bodyguards and started asking the kid some questions about his political beliefs and what he hoped to accomplish with his demonstration.  The guy stammered and stuttered for a few minutes, realized he had no idea what to say, and left looking like a total idiot.

It would be nice if all our leaders could handle a similar situation with the same kind of panache, but we really should judge our leaders (or condemn them) based on standards other than the conduct of their security people.
I was listening to a story presented on Science Friday, a show on NPR, that discusses an IEEE article on the Iraq power grid. During that discussion the guest described some of the rules the security convoys follow when traveling.

The policy seems to be the following (I listened to it two days ago so I could be off):

Do not let vehicles get too close to a convoy

If a vehicle gets too close fire warning shots

If the vehicle does not slow down after a warning shot then fire a shot through the passenger window

If the vehicle still does not comply then shoot out the radiator

I agree with you on your points. I just want to point out that most people do think freedom of expression should have some restrictions. I suppose I am just nitpicking, but we have a whole lot of laws and cases limiting freedom of expression. For one you can't express yourself by blowing things up. There is also copyright law, libel law, obscenity. There has always been a balance between expression and order.

All this said, I think that the protestors are going against freedom of expression and I cannot agree with them. If your idea can't stand up to criticism, how great can the idea be?
Well if I refused to leave, yes.   I think the organizers were schmucks for not giving her a ride back to her car and pressing trespassing charges but I also think she was silly to choose getting arrested instead of walking in the rain.  I also think a 55 year old woman who chooses to go to a rally for a party she doesn't support should be able to avoid responding to the speaker with primal wails that carried across an airplane hanger.

The whole story sounds a bit bizarre from both points of view.

Yeah, from that quaint little Texas farming community called New Haven, Connecticut
When I'm 55 I don't want folks claiming I'm too old to walk in the rain.
They really should have given her a ride or something, but this woman made some really stupid decisions.  You don't laugh in court.  You don't mouth off to highway patrol officers.

&gt; Patterson: "Why was I taken out of the building?"

&gt; Willis: "What are you trying to prove?"

&gt; Patterson: "Nothing. I just had an emotional reaction. I really don't think the world is a safer place under George Bush."

And don't argue with the Secret Service when they've already been provoked.  That goes for local police under the same circumstances.  Those officers only have a [few seconds](http://www.gladwell.com/blink/index.html) to judge whether you're a threat to the person they're protecting, and they're under a lot of stress, and they don't care about inconveniencing you or hurting your feelings.

Paranoid security people -- who we pay to be that way -- could credibly claim that Patterson's actions might have been a diversion for someone else who wanted to harm the veep.

Sorry.  Didn't mean to imply that.

Still not great choices though.

The really odd part though is this: The guy told her "walk down that road and leave, or be incarcerated.", then handcuffed her, read her rights and cited her with criminal trespass.  He then proceeds to give her a ride to her car!
I don't think she's really aguing that.  She's not suing or anything.  She'd just like the charges against her dropped.
Ok, fine, let's assume this is in "self offense", some proactive protocol to make sure no cars get too close.  They are still shooting at civilians 99% of the time, and even if they are aiming to make "warning shots", they are still firing in the direction of innocent people and no matter how good of a shot they are, firing from one moving vehical at another they can't be certain they won't hit someone.  Any way you look at it, it's just plain wrong.

Ironically, the US being in Iraq is the exact same thing.  Sure, someone from al-Whatever could know someone else in Iraq, but going in there and blowing up buildings with "Shock and Awe" is just as mindless and just as wrong.  Either way, you're killing innocent people just to give yourself a false sense of security.
In the beginning, God created the algorithm. Hmm...*programmer fundamentalism.*  The essay reminds me of creationist/intelligent design arguments: evolution is too messy; it's more easily explained in this here book of poetry called Genesis. 

The author should at least get credit for explaining why (or how) so many programmers are libertarian and a big bonus for pointing out how simplistic the philosophy is. Fortunately, the big and messy world of people and culture is more complex than any contrived domain.
Certainly, shooting requires concentration; I've been shooting for 20 years. It also requires that you pay attention to your surroundings so as to avoid shooting something/someone you shouldn't.
You don't have to colonize a country in order to influence it. One example is the assistance the US provided to the Bath party. The CIA used to meet with young Bathists like Sadam as part of a plot to remove Gen. Kassem.

Here is a link to some pictures of the "Victory" group that was in the clip. In one picture you can see the sign that is on the back of the trucks they use when traveling. 

http://www.aegisiraq.co.uk/Victory.htm
&gt; I have heard of many more people going from the UK to US or even to India for their health care than anyone going to the UK.

Virtually anyone travelling from the UK to the US for healthcare is going because a treatment is not available at home, not because the NHS is crap. The UK has incoming health tourism from many countries but mostly European ones for obvious reasons. It's also noteworthy that Americans pay more than double for their healthcare than people from most other developed countries. 

&gt; I myself would never leave my life in the hands of the NHS.

In that case, you shouldn't take any medical care in the UK.  

&gt; Not all doctors are trained by the NHS, you neglect to point out the doctors from India and Pakistan

Yes, the UK does import doctors from abroad in both the private and public sectors but that is irrelevant to the OP's assertions that the NHS is incapable while the private sector provides adequate care (as though all the low-grade doctors are NHS while the hotshots are all private). The fact is that you will usually see NHS doctors in NHS facilities whether you go public or private.

&gt;Having socialized medicine is all fine and good when you are healthy, but give it a go when you develop cancer or some other pathology.

Before you put too much faith in the US way of doing things, you might want to read this from a recent UN report ( http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0908-06.htm ) 

"The infant mortality rate in the US is now the same as in Malaysia

High levels of spending on personal health care reflect America's cutting-edge medical technology and treatment. But the paradox at the heart of the US health system is that, because of inequalities in health financing, countries that spend substantially less than the US have, on average, a healthier population. A baby boy from one of the top 5 per cent richest families in America will live 25 per cent longer than a boy born in the bottom 5 per cent and the infant mortality rate in the US is the same as Malaysia, which has a quarter of America's income. "
I was just reading the board myself. It looks like Aegis had a policy of not putting warning signs on their SUVs, but they still would shoot at cars that came too close. 

The posters on the board were recanting stories in which some teams would have to break company policy and put signs on the SUVs anyway. They thought the rule was ridiculous and was causing unnecessary casualties. 

I can't believe they would not have warning signs. That is the least they could do to avoid a civilian casualties.

I hope you work for a private security contractor...otherwise you need to follow the law.
My first thought when I saw the article was, "Don't tell me they are going to try and justify killing people the same way they are justifying spying on US citizens."
And while the English reads, "Stay Back," the Arabic says: "We're crazy motherfuckers who kill for sport."
I can't believe that you would consider it acceptable to "often" have these vehicles carry warning signs. The should ALWAYS carry warning signs. That is the least they could  do to avoid civillian casualties.

Why is midlifecrisis modded down so much?  Granted, hunting is a far cry from torture, but "killing animals for fun" seems like a pretty fair description, don't you think?

Sure, some/many hunters may eat what they kill, but it's not as if they have no other way of getting food, or that it's even the most convenient way.

Personally, I have been reading reddit more often than digg simply because most of the comments (whether I agree with them or not) aren't brainless trolls (and, gasp, they're threaded).  

It seems the average digg poster's intelligence (not to over generalize) is worse than even Slashdot.

If you wear glasses, try taking them off. That'll blur things sufficiently, and it's very convenient for this sort of thing. [Great, does this mean that I'm now a Smug Glasses Weenie?]
That might depend. Say you're wearing a turbant, or have a large beard. Then, in your case, according to the Bush administration, that'll get you Gitmo.
The funnier part is the comments from people asking that the joke be explained
There's nothing implicitely wrong with bird hunting. Except that, since we're talking about Cheney, I can't for the life of me imagine why he didn't do target practices with pieces from that museum in Iraq (you know, "the history of civilization" and all the democrat wuss talk).
I've heard that's what the looting was for. You know, shooting clay tablets with cuneiform writings... Like, what are /those/ for ?!

i remember one of paul graham's essays talking about mainstream languages gradually adopting the big features of lisp, one by one.  if he's correct, discarding traditional OO practices would be one more step along that path.
Not being able to follow gun safety rules *may* warrant a suspension of your hunting license, but I don't see why you would be sent to jail. If the problem is that you threaten the safety of others while hunting, and you aren't hunting, then there isn't really a problem. Cheney didn't do anything criminal here.

It sounds from the article and some of the comments here that it wasn't entirely his fault either, so it may not even warrant a suspension of his hunting license.

Intellectual Civility "A commitment to take others seriously as thinkers, to treat them as intellectual equals, to grant respect and full attention to their views -- a commitment to persuade rather than to browbeat.  It is distinguished from intellectual rudeness: verbally attacking others, dismissing them, stereotryping their views.  Intellectual civility is not a matter of mere courtesy but, instead arises from a sense that communication itself requires honoring others' views and their capacity to reason.

The author claims that subclassing (is-a) is the primary means of code re-use in "traditional" OOP. He's completely mistaken. Subclassing is the primary means of code re-use employed by unskilled OO programmers. Composition (has-a) is the primary means of code re-use for OO programmers with a clue. This is not--and has never been--a secret.

(For the record, I spend most of my time writing non-OO code in Scheme.)

&gt; "My feeling is that when you harbor a quail, it’s the same as being one."
Personally I don't think all hunters do it for fun. I know when I hunted I did it to get away from the civilized world to clear my head. I also did it for food, as a reminder to myself of how wild things live and that meat is not something to be taken for granted. I didn't NEED the food (I could obviously just run to the super market). I know that I never had fun in the actual killing of the animals I hunted. I eat meat so for me it was an experience to take the life of the animals I eat first hand. It was always a respecful process for me. As little suffering as possible. Only kills I thought I could make clean. For me it  was a way to get away from everything and force myself to take a look at certain aspects of life. 

I have always enjoyed meat fairly well. So as much as possible when I was an active hunter I would only eat the meat that I had personally acquired. Based on the slaughter houses I have seen, it isn't to much of a big leap to say that anything I killed had a better life up until their moment of death.

Mind you I have no qualms with eating meat.. I just found it important at one point in my life to become familiar with what it really meant to take the life of the creature I am eating. The circle of life all of that. If I am going to be an omnivore that eats meat I might as well truly understand what it means to be the predator that actually kills the prey. 

I do think many of the idiots down here in the south do it for the thrill. It excites them. I think many have perverted what hunting was at one time and turned it into a fun recreational activity for them. For me it has always been a somber time of reflection on the nature of being a meat eater.

I can see the point that C++ is moving towards functional programming, but the article unfortunately does a poor of making this argument.

It concentrates only on container libraries (why is that C++ folk have such a hang-up with collections and strings, anyway?). It doesn't really say much about normal application development.
Quite possibly the most retarded thing I've seen posted on Reddit. (And I've seen quite a few)

Yes, follow the advice if you're doing a quick wam-bam-thank-you-mam project. It's basically coding by intuition. It works. But it's not very nice trying to make sense of the code of 10 progammers following their intuition...Especially if they're free to decide which (error)states can/cannot occur.
no, it needs a**holes like you..
That argument hasn't been made in the mainstream for about 10 years. I think the myth was debunked pretty quickly.

Well I guess it is re-use compared to non OO languages like COBOL, thats for sure, so its all relative.

Of course, reuse taken to the extreme means macros that generate macros that generate etc...

still you end up twitching about with a high level S expression language that only the creator once understood.

Then they rewrite it in an OO language.

I think its more a case of taking on more and more functional ideas. 

And I don't think it really had much to do with LISP. I think it will have more to do with needing to be massively parallel to take advantage of the "new" moores law.

Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water here. Inheritance is indeed overrated. Encapsulation, however, leads to improved code maintainability and readability, and to some extent to reuse. Good programmers just take it for granted now that data structures should be grouped with the functions that access those structures and algorithms that operate on them.

The fact that wild game isn't loaded up with growth hormones and antibiotics is one good reason. Wild animals also tend to lead better lives than those on factory farms.
"Inheritance incurs another onerous problem: it propagates bugs. A faulty member function in a base class contaminates every derived class."

And a faulty library function contaminates all the code that uses it. That's why I only code in hex on machines I built myself using rocks and wire hangers.

Every source I've ever seen lists his birthplace as New Haven, CT. Furthermore, the Bush family is New England upper-class to the bone -- has been for a long time.

The point I'm trying to make is that this "aw, shucks" good-ol'-boy, pickup-drivin', hat-wearin', brush-clearin' ranch boy image is just that -- an image, carefully cultivated to make him appeal more to the "values voters" who (at this point) are pretty much all the support he has left.

Yes, I also think that disappearing the picture to show the size info is heavy-handed. (The only time I like it is when you invert things: info as the normal view, picture as the onmouseover one--everything else but size info disappears and you just gulp it all. Try it by clicking anywhere around the thumbnails.) 

The trouble with highlighting as a way to convey the info is that it's very hard to do it consistently with thumbnails that come in just about any color combination.

I would also love for thumbnails to grow slightly a la Mac OSX Dock but that would involve me taking the positioning from the browser and doing it myself--which looks like one big nasty mess.

I actually got almost to the end before I "got it"... was very puzzled for a while. Very unfortunate names indeed :)
Are you claiming that writing secure code requires that you implement handling of all corner cases first time?

Really, don't be silly. You don't forget them. You catch those corner cases later, because you review and test secure code. Several times, in different ways. 

What is true, is that you come up with ideas of corner cases when you are implementing a function first time. But if you try to solve all cases right, you really lose your focus. 

Often handling obscure cases properly requires much more than simple if-clause. If one case pops in your mind, just comment that. You can focus on that later and implement it with care.

He confuses Modula-2 with Simula.

STL is a recent addition to C++? Haha. Sounds like someone picked up a functional langauge and then went back to look at the STL and it finally clicked with them.

I think in a while this guy is going to realize how awful the syntax of C++ and error messages are when he attempts to write more and more code in a parametric polymorphic and functional style. Then he will pine for a functional language without garbage collection to replace C++ -which won't happen.
I'm a Democrat, I totally sympathize (I modded this up), but this is technically trespassing: refusing to leave private property when asked.

If you're going to write an entire article on why object orientation is bad, it might be a good idea to present som e arguments that support this. Saying that deriving all containers from a common base class is a mistake without describing *why* it is a mistake makes for a pretty dull read.

While a lot of what he says might be correct (subclassing is not a good idea to gain reuse) he never presents any arguments for why this is so and indeed seems oblivious to the counter aerguments that exist.

Subclassing spreads bugs, but so does all code reuse.
Member functions leads to bloat, but convenience methods make a class easier to use etc etc.

At OSCON 2004, George Dyson described a hack that (I think) a friend of his came up with. All you do is run seawater through an ordinary commercial snow machine, the kind used to create snow for ski slopes. You blow the salt-snow onto, basically, a grid.

Tiny salt crystals melt minute quantities of water around them as they go, and gravity pulls the liquid water down. It sluices through the grid and, after sufficient time, what's left on top is salt-free snow.

There are engineering problems left to tackle, of course, but apparently it's a cheap way to desalinize water.

notice someone's comment on the page:
Don’t suppose you guys actually read this through… it’s asking that SVOD services be set as “Copy Never”. It’s not asking that normal broadcast TV be marked this way. Because VOD is Video on _Demand_, there’s no reason to record it to your DVR, you simply order it from the VOD screens. The reason for this is because HBO, and the cable provider can get metrics on activity as well as charge for certain events over and over. Currently with Comcast, when you pay for HBO as a premium channel for normal broadcast, you also get HBO VOD free.

Yeah, I hate Hugo Chavez, too.
Its curious that software community endlessly talk about programming paradigms but never really draw a strong parallel with the other industries which all employ pervasive REUSE (manufacturing, engineering, etc). Why do companies always buy their furniture systems off the shelf but rewrite/redevelop their timesheet system?

Sensible reuse starts not with endlessly customized software components but simple, standardized systems/services with a well-understood business interface. What significant value does a customized timesheet system provide over a off-the-shelf one? Similarly for other systems - Performance Management, Asset Management, ERP, HRIS, and so on....

It could be that software is so critical to the Enterpise that it must be customized every time for the high business value of information, or we could standardize like say the auto industry - where you can buy a tire and are pretty much guaranteed it will fit (although there are so many sizes and varieties - yet all standardized).

The software industry must stop self-flagellation about esoteric paradigms and intellectual masturbation and instead focus on the more compelling need to standardize its business interfaces.

Hence software must look at business to simplify and standardize. Its tools are already pretty good as they are and discussed to death...whereas it never really discusses business reuse.

right on midlifecrisis. let's tell those despicable "meat eaters" what's up. no more death to animals. i cant believe my insurance company wont cover my pets to get the care they need. my cat needs dialysis
What is she arguing, then?  She could have reacted to this situation in any number of better ways.  What she did was *stupid*, like pissing off Joe Pesci's character in a mobster movie:

&gt; It was raining, Patterson's car was more than a mile away and the shuttles weren't shuttling. She asked again to speak with the person in charge. Willis repeated that she would have to leave or be arrested. "**I guess you'll have to arrest me**," she replied.

You don't get any 'takebacks' if you ask a police officer to arrest you.
Playing Devil's Advocate a little bit, why should Target's website be excluded from the ADA while Target's physical buildings must comply?

Seems to me it'd be cheaper and easier to make a website comply than a building.
"I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind." -- Alan Kay

I vaguely remember reading something where Kay said that if he had it to do all over again he would not have called it "object oriented" programming, he would have called it "message oriented" or something along those lines, because a system based on pure message passing (and extremely late binding) was what he considered most important about Smalltalk, not stuff like class heirarchies and inheritance.

This article takes for granted that "classic object orientation" means "object orientation as implemented in, say, Java or C++" -- the criticisms do not really apply to Smalltalk, Self, Ruby, and the like, at all.  Just the statically typed languages. (If I'm using that term correctly.)

So maybe the lesson is that OO causes problems when you try to marry it to relatively early binding languages like Java &amp; C++?

This article is of very poor quality. Based on opinions, not data. Thank you, europeans live much better than countries not obsessed with social security. As for dynasties, check the bushes and the kennedies...

Thank you, but wikipedia is not a reliable source.  It's good for gossip, but not for facts.  For facts, I'd need a scientific journal or similar.

Also, I'd like to add that I have nothing against moderate muslims at all.  It's the religious fundamentalists, including christians, that concern me.

"The origins of algebra can be traced to the cultures of the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians who used an early type of algebra to solve linear, quadratic, and indeterminate equations more than 3,000 years ago."

Not that I would trust this entry either, but this highlights the problem with wiki.  Anybody can say anything, therefore nothing is trustworthy.

Arabs apparently contributed to the world's knowledge of astronomy.  I didn't know that!  

However, there's a huge leap between adding to knowledge of a known subject, and discovering something for the first time.  

Not discounting the Arab contribution at all.  The original poster of this thread was saying that muslims invented algebra, astronomy.  I suspected that assertion could easily be proven false, and I was correct.

At face value this is a video of occupying troops excessively beating on local kids...

If you google for "circle ellipse liskov" you'll find a bunch of discussion. (Circle/ellipse is the canonical version of this issue, which deals with the Liskov Substitution Principle, which says that if B derives from A that you should be able to use a B anywhere you could use an A).
I agree.  And that's why she got arrested.  It still makes sense for them to drop the charges though.

You know, I have to admit to uncovering some prejudice within myself after reading this.  

Of course!  The scientists would naturally feel restricted in a muslim country, and therefore they would emigrate elsewhere.  It is in less restricted countries where their ideas are developed, and where they receive credit for their work.  This explains why I never hear about Arabs inventing anything.  

It also explains why, that yes, horribly restrictive muslim countries will always have to be the buyers of new technology, never the inventors.

Also, as long as a country treats their women like property, they will never have the respect of countries that are far more enlightened.
Your point is totally correct, but a nitpick:

&gt; There is no right to speak at a private event.

There's a right to speak absolutely anywhere you're allowed to be. They can, however, revoke your permission to be in a private event if you don't follow their rules. See the distinction?
There are facts that support the opinions of the article.  For example, the study, published June 2004, at http://www.timbro.com/euvsusa/pdf/EU_vs_USA_English.pdf (which is replete with facts) says:

    "Most Americans have a standard
    of living which the majority of
    Europeans will never come
    anywhere near. The really
    prosperous American regions have
    nearly twice the affluence of
    Europe. It is worth reminding
    ourselves what this means. In
    these regions the average
    American can get exactly twice
    as much of everything as the
    average European."

The report also shows that the EU15 per capita income is below that of all the states of the US except Arkansas, Montana, West Virginia, and Mississippi.

The report is detailed and well worth reading.
I first read this as "Geek Farmer finds..." and I was all like "a geek farmer? what?" and then I was like "oh, OK, cool!  must read!" and then I read it and I was like "ohhh...  duhh..."

Helter, it is always interesting to read differing viewpoints.  I did learn some things from this thread, mainly because of you, and people arguing against you.  Please don't feel bad.

However, I'm even more opposed to restrictive fundamentalists now more than ever.

I'm willing to hear more, though.  I know some moderate muslims here in the united states, and they seem okay.

Of course, creationists accept micro-evolution (e.g. drug-resistent bacteria, moths changing colour in England); what they dispute is macro-evolution (e.g. fish becoming mammals by way of amphibians and reptiles).  I'm not a creationist myself--I believe that evolution is God's design method--but they are not the idiots Trudeau thinks they are.

Someone challenged me several years ago to read foreign news media, in order to obtain a different perpective.  I was ashamed to discover some things about my country, and my own perceptions that weren't true as I had thought.

This is yet another example.  I think I'd like to find a forum for mostly moderate muslims, and just read what they have to say (not intrude on their right to have a space that's just for them) or find a place where I can discuss things without feeling like I am intruding.
Cut him some slack.  I'm beginning to like Helter.  He obviously has a different viewpoint from the majority of redditers (hey! I made up a new word!) but he has been nothing but respectful, and reasonable with his arguments.

By now, I probably would have succumbed to insults, if I were him.  ;)

(Although it's apparent he lost his patience here.)
Can we somehow ban this "Darrell" guy?  He's nothing more than a self-promoting scumsack.
I think Trudeau is just pointing out that it's hard to be a "real world" creationist (or, more appropiately: "anti-evolutionist").  One of science's great appeals is that it accurately describes (and can even generate novel predictions about) the world.  Thus, it is attractive both as an intellectual/philosophical pursuit (e.g., understanding the world and one's place in it), and as a tool for problem-solving (e.g., curing disease, developing new fuels).

Creationism might offer some easy answers in the former case (the philosophical), but is *not* a terribly useful framework for the practical.

I agree that there is a "cheap laugh" in there, however.
Wow, lots of bad karma for stating a plain fact! ;)
Downgraded since that little #-sign link at the end of each paragraph is annoying as hell.
I would submit that Gary Trudeau and many others know exactly what the Creationist arguments are.
I'm with you on the debt issue, I just wanted to note that medical treatments can be *very* expensive.

I also agree that we don't know the details of the patient's condition and prognosis.  However, I (not being an oncologist) am willing to defer to the patient's doctor (an oncologist, no doubt) in matters of determining the necessary and/or appropriate medical treatment.  I think the insurance company should do the same.

"The task required a camera shutter that captured exposures of 1/1,000,000th of a second, too fast for moving parts. EG&amp;G [Edgerton's company] came up with a novel solution. Instead of a conventional shutter, two polarizing filters kept the film in the dark until the filters were exposed to a magnetic field. For an instant, as the plane of polarization rotated, light was able to hit the film. Thus EG&amp;G obtained its infinitesimally small exposure times."

I copied a string to the clipboard from outside IE, and it was visible.
Why not put insert(), assign(), replace(), sort(), copy() and the like to a superclass of the classes to which they are applicable?  This would eliminate the redundancy.  Because inheritance is generally bad (... for unknown reasons)?  I mean I see cases where this couldn't be done elegantly, but it seems to me that the proposal described in the article isn't elegant in the same cases.
This article just doesn't live up to its title and is subpar even for informit's typical level of content. The author starts up with paper tiger examples of bad libraries like the NIH containers which were condemned as poor practice (trying to implement Smalltalk class libs in C++) from the beginning (prior to 1990 from my own experience).

Then he attacks OO by condemning uses of inheritence. All his attacks are examples of poor OO design and have been known as such for decades now. All idioms can and will be abused so let's deal with corrent practices. Well - to be an OO language it must have 3 attributes: encapsulation, inheritence, and polymorphism. C++ is clearly an OO language but it is also a multi-paradigm language. Its template facilities (especially when combined with OO feaures like inheritence) make it incredibly expressive without giving up runtime performance. As long ago as 1994 I've often said that given the choice between losing inheritence or losing templates in C++, I'd give up the inheritence. But the flexibility of both makes C++ uniquely powerful (see Coplien's "Curiously Reoccuring Pattern").

Of course, everything I just said is nothing new. But that's my point - there is nothing new or informative in this article at all. Its obviously written with a, sadly not uncommon, bias against OO but the correct conclusion is not that OO is bad or in decline. Far from it. OO is an incredibly powerful idiom that will be with us as long as I can imagine. Fortunately, its presence in languages like C++ and python have made concepts like functional programming idioms more available and accepted in common software development rather than restricted to the pure functional languages. I feel very fortunate to have both and see them as augmenting each other rather than competing concepts.

That looks like a pretty cool game.
Wikipedia's entry on Festivus, the imaginary holiday invented by an imaginary person -- Seinfeld's Frank Costanza -- is longer than its entry on Presidents' Day (1848 words vs. 595 words)

It is not a number itself (ie population) of a country that necessarily dictates technologically advancement, but the number or *percentage* of that population which is engaged in the sciences.  When intelligent design is taught as a "scientific theory", it lowers the expection and standard of what real science is all about.

The global population is rising, not decreasing.

I have yet to determine by what method the experts claim the population will mysteriously decrease -

when the current facts say otherwise -

There is most definately a trend toward women having less babies as their education increases, but . . . global population has done nothing but increase since time began.

Even if every couple only "replace themselves", each generation will still double.

If my spouse and I have two children, and they in turn each have two children, I will have four grandchildren. If each grandchild marries and each couple decides to "replace themselves", I will have eight great-grandchildren.
What kind of filament does it have??
A declining birthrate would only negatively impact the GNP because the GNP measures just that, growth of more money circulating in the economy.

If the goals of a country were stable amounts of money circulating in the economy, but increases in education and technology and stardard of living, the GNP would not be important.

All true (in my experience), but then the question becomes: if only unskilled OO programmers use inheritance, why does it feature so prominently in most OO books, tutorials, languages, and frameworks?  Why not just support dictionaries of functions, like in Scheme (or C, for that matter)?

Inheritance becomes even more of a problem with type inference, because it often make type inferencing undecidable.  Given the choice between having the computer figure out my types for me and allowing inheritance, I'd rather take type inference - but there's already so much momentum behind inheritance that it'd be tough to switchover.
Unsettling.
All evolution occurs on the molecular level whether it pertains to viruses, bacteria, or mammals. Creationists believing in micro-evolution is nonsense.
I've been to the tidepools and this isn't the best location to shoot for them.
I know that Seed isn't a "real" scientific journal, but it would be nice if their articles were just a tad closer to science.  Prions are interesting, but it's been known for a long time that proteins can change other proteins' structure (e.g. chaperones).  At the beginning of the article, he talks about the transfer of information directly from DNA to protein as if it's only that simple.  In fact, there is a large amount of editing that occurs between DNA and protein, some of which even changes the sequence of the protein.  Also, amino acid sequence is not the only thing that determines protein structure.  Chaperone proteins can force a protein into a more effective but less energetically favored form.  Finally, he misspelled "Mendelian."  Not good.
Overall, I wish he had gone into the evidence of prions as hereditary material, in which case I might have been more convinced of his point.  As it stands, this article isn't particularly informative.

That is a funny way of conceptualizing a 'right'.  We all certainly have free will.  You can say whatever you want until you are physically gagged.  You can be wherever you want to be until you are physically restrained.

The issue is what are the consequences associated with your actions?  Can the government punish you for your actions?  Can other people punish you (via the government) for your actions?  Is it OK for other people to threaten you based on your speech or presence?

To the extent that a free society tries to minimize the circumstances that lead to punishment for speech or for peaceful assembly it maximizes those associated rights.  These rights aren't absolute because the circumstances often involve other people and their speech and peaceful assembly also.

All these things have to be balanced but the goal should be to *maximize* the individual freedoms for everyone (equal application of the laws) and that may result in punishment for individuals that insist on needlessly infringing on other people's rights (interrupting private gatherings, trespassing, threatening and so on).

I should say that a unilateral claim that you have been 'offended' is not evidence that your rights have been infringed.  In order to maximize individual rights we also have to accept that we'll be 'offended' at times and
perhaps even a lot.   No one likes to be offended but the alternative is to
proscribe speech so much that we all are limited to the sensibilities of the
most easily offended among us.
Yeah, screw y'all, too!

On a second thought -- can anyone explain to me what's so "secret" about that cause?

The clipboard contents are pasted into the textarea clientside by javascript, as below - the server had no idea what was in your clipboard, however an AJAX style webpage could still send the content of the textarea somewhere.

function PasteFromClipboard(txtArea)

{

   PastedText=txtArea.createTextRange();

   PastedText.execCommand("Paste");

}


This "Paste" command makes me wonder if javascript websites might have access to "copy" as well - something I've wished for with a few webpages, but assumed you couldn't do.

Just tested it with IE6 under Wine, and it displayed the URL as I copied it from the Firefox clipboard.
The difference betwenn religious and non-religious people like that is the reason they have for their actions. No atheist kills theists because he was told to do it in a 2000 year old book. They have reasons from their own life, good or bad ones, but the reasons are their own, not the ones of long dead people.
True, though presumably you could use Ajaxy techniques to get it back to the server at the drop of a hat.
Not sure if you're being sarcastic, but as a diehard logan's run fan, I end up pointing out a lot that there were some elements in The Island that were inspired by Logan's Run, but it was not at all a remake. That being said, I'm excited that the remake is finally going somewhere as there has been talks of it for years. Unfortunately, a lot of what I liked about the original- mainly all that comes along with being a 70's post-apocalyptic utopia/distopia film- will be lost and replaced with modern sci-fi/action elements, which will probably make it unwatchable for me.
I don't know to be scared or thrilled. Going to be quite a challenge to remake this flick right. I'd love to see it done right. Don't know how they can top Jenny Agutter as Jessica 6 though... Don't screw it up guys.

Haven't we had enough of ideology?  America doesn't need an ideological left any more than it needs the current ideological right that is firmly entrenched in Washington.

What we need is a rejection of ideologies in favour of pragmatic, commonsensical, reformist, truthful ideals.

The immorality of the Iraq war, for example, is not because it is an invention of the American right.  This unethical untruthful immorality is the product of an ideology, but an opposing ideology is not required to consider it, attack it, and ultimately end it.
Wait, so, don't don't follow it? I'm confused.

We are content, happy sheep! 

In light of two other articles on reddit today (one about our level of wealth and comfort in the US relative to places such as Congo, the other about how people seek pleasure), it's easy to see that we don't care because our liberties and well-being have simply not been eroded *enough*. I guess some people are troubled enough to think about these things and write blogs and opinion pieces, and there's a handful who are willing to spend time, effort and money in active protest, but they are a small fraction of the American population. The rest of us are still comfortable.

Interesting: that in order to incite rebellion and regime change, we must make the government even more odious than it currently is.
This is why the rule of law is so important.  With out our politicians living by the law we will become victims of arbitrary anger.  This is why Bush's survelance should be stopped.  If it's not then someday I will get rended by a politico and be given a ticket, or shot on the premises.

More seriously, I think the author needs a calendar. The firebrands of the 60's are pushing 60 themselves. The younger generation is of a very different character. They are more like their great-grandparents who fought in WWII. They are very conformist and... politically naive. The ones in between, the Xers, have never had the cohesion necessary for mass political action. These cycles have come up before... I expect another 'revolution' like the 60's around the 2050's or so. Until then it's not productive to pout.

I think what you mean is that we need a rejection of **ignorance**.  Ideologies are fine as long as they are well informed.  The problem isn't that people have opinions, it's that most people don't have a rational understanding of the world around them as a foundation or framework for their opinions.

So the leftists who hate Bush because they don't like his Texas accent, beady eyes or odd facial expressions should keep it to themselves.  But I like to hear from leftists who believe that Bush is a terrible president because he has demonstrated his incompetence to hold the position through numerous specific and verifiable acts.

Ideologues who can make rational arguments, backed up by solid evidence, should be given their due consideration and respect regardless of what beliefs they adhere to.  Don't make ideology a bad word just because of the things that ignorant people say or do in service to theirs.

It's not cited in the article, but I found it referenced in the NYT piece.  The study was originally published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and they've made available for free on their website.

Here we go again...a GNU project reinventing the wheel - badly. PDF creates huge files. It's not adequate for scanned documents.
The document format of choice for scanned pages is DJVU format.
DJVU achieves higher compression than PDF and uses cutting edge wavelet technology.
Unfortunately, this is the newest GNU manifestation of the NIH syndrome.
DJVU, interestingly, was prototyped in AT &amp; T with the Lisp derivative for high-performance computing called Lush. 

You can get a GPLed dvjviewer too.
apt-get install djvu

Ah, The Economist! Ideology dressed up as dispassionate analysis. Arrogant enough not to attribute any articles to any specific authors. It all just comes from... God! Bible of the modern-day priesthood (pinstripes are the new habit). Always good for a laugh. Just don't take any of it too seriously. Otherwise you'll end up like those boys in the city, smugly reading their faux-intellectual rag with the mistaken belief that only they and their compadres are grappling with the micro and macro details of our society. How easily sheep are herded into their masters mindset.

Um, no.  I can think of many languages that are more expressive than C++ - lisp, ruby, python, perl, and smalltalk top the list.  They're dynamically typed, and none of them have free().

If I were to say that "perl, python, and ruby are all blindingly fast, and still retain their powerful abstraction capacities," you'd laugh, right?

&gt; It's surprising to see that the original notions of OOP such as inheritance, virtual functions and member functions have become so antiquated and cumbersome in the last 10 years

These aren't *technologies* that become obsolete like a 3-year-old CPU.  They're concepts.  Concepts don't become obsolete.  No one has ever felt the need to upgrade to a base-11 number system.  If inheritance, virtual functions, and member functions are a bad idea now, they were a bad idea then, too.

Hi pmendoza,

I shot at high tide unfortunately. Please feel free to recommend a better spot and I will be glad to add it to the site.
I used to blame Dick, but now I figured out that I should blame American sheepiness and ignorance. I mean, guys like Cheney are everywhere in the world and they always have been everywhere. Germany, Russia, China etc. It's just that they aren't stopped by Americans.

Whom should I blame when guys like that come to power? Apart from the power addicted themselves? In my opinion, it's the responsibility of Americans to stop their fellow dictators. It's okay to point my finger at them when they don't, isn't it?
"Almost every day during the hunting season you see at least one item in the newspapers about somebody who has shot somebody else, under the impression that he was a deer with a red hat, perhaps.

His point is off topic.  Everyone else is busy talking about Cheny's plans for world domination via birdshot, and he brings up an ethical issue without much elaboration.  A lot like a troll.
&gt; "A recent Harris Interactive poll found that 56 percent of all U.S. adults have heard of IPTV and a large portion of those expressed interest in adopting IPTV on their TV's and home PC's."

56%?  Highly unlikely.  I'd be surprised if 56% of them have heard of VOIP.
What does unpaper have to do with PDF? Near as I can tell from the unpaper page, it just works with the page image files for auto deskewing and auto cropping. It's left up to you to convert it to PDF or whatever format you want.

Quickly scanning the links you gave, none of them seem to do that image editing. So use unpaper and then convert to DJVU instead of PDF if your heart desires it.
The whole thing sounds like a clear case of entrapment to me ;)

This article is (surprise surprise) titled in a way to deliberately mislead.

She was charged for violating the rude lady's "personal space"... touching her. She was NOT arrested, and the incident was not because she was asking for quiet.

Overall this article is more about how well our system works (the police only reluctantly upheld the letter of the law, and she will get off lightly, perhaps even with a slap on the wrist), than about how bolloxed it is.
Spif: No, I don't mean a rejection of ignorance.  After all, you can be a perfectly knowledgeable, educated psychopath.  Nazism was well-informed (they had the Gestapo, after all), but as an ideology it is not "fine".

What is important about a presidency or a political movement has less to do with "rational arguments" and far more to do with ethics, among other qualities.

You say, "Ideologues who can make rational arguments, backed up by solid evidence, should be given their due consideration and respect regardless of what beliefs they adhere to."  That is nonsense.  Again, using the Nazis as an extreme example, and a very rational one: a Nazi could make a rational argument about Jewish influence, and back it up with "solid evidence" - Jews, after all, did occupy positions of influence in Germany disproportionate to their numbers - and yet, we reject those arguments from Nazis precisely because of the "beliefs they adhere to".

Instead of the problem being that "most people don't have a rational understanding of the world around them", the problem is that our elites - not people in general - don't have an ethical understanding of the world around them, one that is rooted in common sense, memory and guided - not determined - by reason.

The problem with ideologues is they create a rational prism through which to view the world.  In doing so, they miss the forest for the trees.
Always with the Bush bashing eh. Stick to the point. Human rights violations in Russia.

I'm not sure what you think "ideology" means. Just because Nazism was a bad ideology doesn't mean ideology is bad.

"Pragmatic, commonsensical, reformist, truthful ideals" is an ideology. We Liberals tend to think that ours is mostly all four of those things. Otherwise we wouldn't be Liberals. Ditto for the neocons. They're wrong about the Iraq war, but not because they're neocons.

Dunno what you specifically disagree with in this guy's article. We have no national debate. The House of Representatives is no longer a deliberative body. America is, currently, kindof broken.
I don't know what you're talking about. You can be charged with creating a disturbance, but you can't be arrested for telling GW you think he's an idiot, even if you're on private property.

Once you tell GW he's an idiot, they may wish to eject you from that private property. If you refuse to leave you may be charged with trespassing. You do have a "right to speak at a private event". You just don't have a right to **be** at a private event.
and for those that don't know, [reStructured Text (aka rst)](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) is another popular syntax. Its best know for being heavily used in python documentation.
I've had that happen often with Windows XP.  About once a week.  On a bad day, it might happen a few times.  Which is why I stopped using it in favor of Linux (and then eventually left Linux for Mac since I was tired of having to fiddle to get stuff to work).
&gt; How are Bush/Cheney events different from other political rallies? Plenty of pro-Bush folks are fanatical enough to try and crash Democrats' rallies. Why do we never see or hear them succeed?

They're very similar, now. Liberal politicians have learned from the neocon example and do their best to comb their audience for opposition. I'm pretty sure the last Democratic Party national convention employed "free speech zones".
I liked this because prions are very cool, not only because of how they act and what they do, but because their conformational changes will likely teach us a ton about the problem of protein folding.  That said, when the author writes:

&gt;Biologists need to get used to the idea that there’s no end in sight when it comes to new insights and scientific breakthroughs—an idea that has long been accepted by physicists who are subject to regular scientific revolutions. 

He reveals how little he knows of biology, and how little he knows about the history of biology.  Prions aren't *that* revolutionary, in that of course we know there are non-DNA types of information whirling about continuously.  he doesn't even mention epigenetic factors such as chromatin!  From evo-devo, to the molecular biology revolution, the neo-darwinian synthesis, and even all the way back to Darwin shows continuous large scale change in how biologists see the world.

Physics has been the dominant science of the 20th century, but we are now building the tools where we can begin to tackle something orders of magnitude more complex: life.  I think that biological discoveries will be the big ones of the 21st century, and its not a very original opinion.
Can I ask exactly what application crashes the whole of XP when it happens?

Various..... oftentimes just Windows Explorer would crash.  Technically, that usually didn't bring the whole system down, but it's pretty hard to use Windows with explorer dead, so I would restart.  One nice thing about Macs is that if Finder (the equivelant to explorer.exe) crashes, you can easily restart it, no need to reboot.

Besides that, there was never any specific applications that would cause me problems (save for one where I can't remember the name, an odd little freeware program that would crash the system with a certain combination of pausing and switching between fullscreen and windowed mode - but I only used that briefly).
Everything that can trigger a bug in something that runs as a driver. Games crash Windows through DirectX or buggy Copy Protection Drivers, Movie players through codecs, ...
An ideology is a set of doctrines or beliefs.  Being an ideologue has various negative effects, mostly because ideology obscures or alters reality.  Religion is a classic example of an ideology that tends to produce specific, often one-sided viewpoints, which are frequently detrimental to followers of other faiths.  In American politics, the "left" and the "right" have become like religions that are utterly opposed to one another.

Take your example:

"Pragmatic, commonsensical, reformist, truthful ideals" is an ideology. We Liberals tend to think that ours is mostly all four of those things.

If I may rephrase "Liberals" concretely as Democrats - many of whom identify with "liberal" or "progressive" - what you're saying is that Democrats think they are reformist, to pick an examples of a quality I think is important.

The problem is that the Democrats are not reformist, since they seem to be making no real progress or effort to reform American politics.  No rush to toss the thousands of Washington lobbyists out on their asses.  No rush to limit corporate donations.  No rush to rein in the out-of-control military-industrial complex or the revolving doors that send employees of this complex into public office and back again.

So this is a classic example of the problem with ideologies: adopt one that says "I am reformist", and one need no longer stop to wonder if one really IS working towards reform.

Where I disagree with the author is the wistful longing for more ideologues.  And I'm tired of the constant left/right nonsense - do we really need to separate into two teams, left vs. right?  Do we really need to categorize so incessantly?  All this does is lead to the polarization of debate - we no longer listen to each other because we fit you into a category of people we have already decided to disagree with.

As a "Liberal", how many times have you been dismissed out of hand because you identify as a liberal, or because someone puts that label on you and that way has an easy way of dismissing everything you say?  "I disagree with Michael Moore, I think he's an idiot - he's also a liberal - therefore I disagree with liberals - judgmentalist is a liberal - what an idiot".

Is this getting us anywhere or not?

The headline is a misleading bit of propaganda.  The problem is a real one, and one easily enough solved, if people decide that it's important.
You're right, I'm adjusting my statement, your way of saying it is more correct.

I'm pointing my finger at Americans that don't do what they should do to keep people, like the current White House administration, out of power.

I think I'm justified in that.
Anyone whose great-grandparents fought in WWII (like my yet-to-be-born children) will be very naive indeed.  Even so,  I don't think they'll be able to top the hippies and flower children who came before them when it comes to naivete.

But I completely agree that waiting around for the 1960s to come back is not helpful.
Here's a question for anyone who cares to answer: What can I do to effect change?  I put in volunteer time with the ACLU currently every week.  I work for political campaigns I believe in when they come around.

Yet having the right people in power or getting the courts to rule a certain way doesn't seem to do much, and there's no weapon to let one man stand against the entire United States security forces.  So what to DO?
That's not what I'm saying. Maybe my sentence structure made it unclear. What I'm saying is, I think guys like Hitler, Mao, Stalin and to a lesser extent Cheney. People who share characteristics with them are everywhere. They're the minority but they are everywhere.

Simply said, it's up to good people to stop evil people. It sounds easier than it is in practice but you should at least try. It's easier to stop them early (protests, voting) than later on (war).

What I was implying was that Europe and some other countries are resisting the power grab of fascists, the negativistic "pushers". We're not doing enough and we have the advantage of recent history teaching us the characteristics of fascists (and Americans haven't really) but at least most Europeans are doing more than a lot of Americans, who aren't doing enough in my opinion.

&gt; there was never any specific applications that would cause

This is exactly my point. Applications can't bring Windows down post Windows 98. Driver errors can, but not applications.
So drivers, not applications.
&gt; guys like Hitler, Mao, Stalin and to a lesser extent Cheney.
&gt; People who share characteristics with them are everywhere. 

I'm not a Cheney lover, but it offends me no end to see you include him in that list of mass murderers. You do an injustice to the tens of millions that died at the hands of Hitler, Mao, and Stalin.
It's pretty simple, really. [This calendar](http://tron09.com/calendar/2006/02/) is generated by [this wikipage](http://tron09.com/wiki/2006_February). The syntax is simply:

*The reseach was conducted by David Thomas, a chiropractor and nutritionist who prescribes and sells mineral supplements.*
Hmm, so you say the mineral levels are lower David?
Seriously, I do believe that organic is the way to go but this makes the results suspect.  Maybe someone impartial can verify the results.
I agree with you. Ideologies are mostly identified with words, but the meaning behind the words, the semantics, often get changed behind the letters. Like: the Patriot act.

So if you identify yourself as &lt;ideology word&gt; then that often loses it's meaning after a while and all people end up doing is fighting over the surface, the representation, the words instead of the meaning behind the words.

I think the problem is that people like to compress a lot of meanings into one word. I think 1, 2, 3 and 4 and I will call that collection of convictions "Superheroism", for example. When 1, 2, 3 and 4 are good ideas, the idea of superheroism will gain power because of all the ideas it represents. However, you could say you're a superhero, yell it out multiple times a day so people will believe you're serious, and still not do 1, 2, 3, and 4, but do 0, 3 and 666 instead.

That is what is happening in practice. People SAY they're [a patriot/christian/democrat/republican/superhero] but the general population doesn't seem to check behind that label. Is he really doing 1, 2, 3 and 4? They seem to stop looking as soon as they see the word superhero and start yelling at the other groups.

How about this for an ideology:
The world around us is made up of molecules around us at a certain spot at a certain time. So there is a truth. It doesn't mean we can figure out what the truth is, but we know it exists and we know we can come really close to knowing it.

When someone says something which is clearly not true, we say: "that's clearly not true, you're going against the universe."

Or in other words, when someone tries to sell you bullshit, you just say: Nuh-uh, that's bullshit.

Have to have a pretty clear picture of reality first to belong to this ideology though. Good luck with that in America or the Middle-East. Seriously, good luck!
Huh.  It shames me that I never knew that.
Sorry, you can't pick and choose applications of a theory to fit your religion and claim to be scientific. I agree with judgmentalist --people know what the Creationist arguements are, probably especially Gary Trudeau.
Not really, considering 50% of all scientific tests are inaccurate.
Looks pretty dim. Which is probably why it lasts -- filament evaporation is the primary reason bulbs die. You can make any bulb last an insane amount of time by running it far below capacity.
(Turning on and off is only an added stress, not a primary cause, BTW.)
That still doesn't say much about the stability of Windows.  I've seen the blue screen of death in Windows XP often enough.  I won't talk about Me (which is what my computer had preinstalled - gah).  I've had X crash in Linux, and I've had the kernel crash in Linux (due to driver bugs, of course).  I've never had my Mac crash, and I abuse it as much as I did Windows and Linux.  Applications crash on me on a fairly regular basis (Safari crashed on me today, but I've loaded enough hacks on top of it I'd be surprised if it didn't), and Finder occasionally ramps up to 100% CPU usage and stays there 'til I relaunch it (it's still responsive, just sluggish).  But I've never had to restart the computer except when installing an OS update.  That, I do believe, is the point the author was trying to make.
I said: "to a lesser extent", that means not equal. But I do think they share SOME characteristics.

Of course I think that Cheney is responsible for far less people than Hitler. And that Mao is the biggest mass murderer of all time, more than 25 million.

But part of the reason I'm putting them in the same sentence is because I want to help PREVENT people from dying. I hope I'm doing that by writing this. The more people we can PREVENT from dying needlessly premature horrible death, the better no? I'm sure that Mr. Cheney agrees with me on that and would defend my efforts of promoting this ideal.

I'm sorry if I offended you, I'm not trying to lessen the suffering the people must have felt under Hitler, Stalin, Mao etc. I feel a kind of pain when I think of their victims. Please believe me.

And please help me, it's not that hard, we're the majority after all.

You still haven't come up with a REAL example of an app crashing your system on XP.  (other than the explorer thing, which you are always able to restart)

"Orders of magnitude less wouldn't you say?"

Yes, True
I really think aural stylesheets is a very sensitive subject because it's an accessibility minefield. And is not just me. "It is a greater sin to mess with an individual blind visitor’s speech settings via ACSS than any sin you could imagine that affects low-vision or colourblind people. Annoying sounds are far more annoying than annoying images." (Joe Clark, "Building Accessible Websites") Just because ACSS exists, doesn't mean "nice web designers might even throw in a few CSS rules for screenreaders".

Ah, you beat me to it, sir.  Good show.

I agree, and the modding is even worse than on slashdot.
I don't have a low enough level of knowledge of operating systems to say whether an app crashed it, or if an app caused a driver to crash, or if it crashed for some other reason.  It's been over a year since I've last used Windows, and do not particularly recall any single application that would cause a system crash.  I simply recall having frequent system crashes, which is my point.  

I recall one incident where I could crash the system the exact same way every time, using the same application, but I do not recall the name of the application (it was an app used to view and rip videos embedded into Playstation CDs).  More often though, it would crash, and I wouldn't be able to figure out any specific sequence of actions that caused it.


With Linux, crashes were almost always repeatable - and I could simply try to avoid doing whatever it was that caused it to crash.  With Mac OS X, system crashes are non-existant so far (I imagine it's still quite possible to crash it, but I have yet to see it happen on any of the computers I've worked with).

If you really want a more specific example, I can go use Windows for a week or two, and I'll let you know what happens.
Yeah, especially since 90% of all statistics are made up right?

your comment is one of those that the study is talking about, sarcasm or seriousness. Is this statement sarcasm or serious?
I think there is so little reuse because programming languages are so immature. The concepts that belong and don't belong in a language, the human race is figuring it out at the moment.

At the same time, in the meantime, we are using what we have at hand at the moment. It's messy, but it's better than nothing. Because the languages aren't good at reuse (like OO isn't really), we have the situation you describe above.

But things ARE getting better, better languages are coming that are better at reuse. Functional style, single assignment, languages are getting fast enough.
In the past I have seen this idea attributed to Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord:

"I divide my officers into four classes; the clever, the lazy, the industrious, and the stupid. Each officer possesses at least two of these qualities. Those who are clever and industrious are fitted for the highest staff appointments. Use can be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy however is for the very highest command; he has the temperament and nerves to deal with all situations. But whoever is stupid and industrious is a menace and must be removed immediately!"

&gt; Nazism was well-informed (they had the Gestapo, after all), but as an ideology it is not "fine".
&gt; Again, using the Nazis as an extreme example, and a very rational one: a Nazi could make a rational argument about Jewish influence, and back it up with "solid evidence" - Jews, after all, did occupy positions of influence in Germany disproportionate to their numbers - and yet, we reject those arguments from Nazis precisely because of the "beliefs they adhere to".

Overblown generalizations and ridiculous stereotypes do not make for solid evidence, at least in my little world.  Saying that Jewish people were influential in Germany and so that makes what the Nazis did rational is like saying that your neighbor makes more money than you do, so it's rational for you to **kill him and everyone he has ever met**.

Maybe the breakdown here is that you're thinking about what I would call "cold" rationality rather than ethical rationality.  But of course if you use only that kind of rationality then you can justify anything.  That's not what I'm talking about.  Consider this argument:

http://pixnaps.blogspot.com/2005/09/red-pill-ethics-rationality.html

Anyway, the point is that nothing is inherently wrong with ideology.  Even the greatest peacemakers, scientists and philosophers in human history were ideologues.  It's unbending, irrational adherence to an ideology, even in the face of evidence which invalidates it, that is dangerous.  A proper ideologue should always be willing to accept adjustments to their ideology, or to completely reject it, based on the establishment of new facts.

Spif: "Saying that Jewish people were influential in Germany and so that makes what the Nazis did rational is like saying that your neighbor makes more money than you do, so it's rational for you to kill him and everyone he has ever met."

First-degree murder is by definition rational.  The insanity defense relies on proving that the defendant was irrational when committing the murder.

I disagree that there are "kinds" of reason ("rationality"), such as ethical reason or the "cold" reason you refer to.  There are kinds of people, such as people who are ethical and rational at the same time, but reason is quite separate from ethics.  And reason has been used many times to "justify anything" from the creation of more hospitals to mass murder.

But I sense this is an argument that will not be resolved between us, and I think we've hashed out most of what we have to say on the issue, so see you later - it's been interesting debating with you.  And I'll be sure to avoid using the Nazi comparison in the future.  ;)
guess not. :(

The part on fat in chicken meat is especially interesting.  I always thought chicken meat was a healthier alternative.
I love R.  It is an amazingly powerful environment for statistical analysis.  That it is Free Software and backed by an active community of developers and researchers makes it all the more inviting.  There are also great front ends available, such as my favorite, Emacs Speaks Statistics:

[ESS: Emacs Speaks Statistics](http://ess.r-project.org/)

You can do all sorts of fun things with R.  Recently, for example, I analyzed the Internet Movie Database:

[Mining gold from the Internet Movie Database, part 1: decoding user atings](http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2006/01/17/mining-gold-from-the-internet-movie-database-part-1)

You might be surprised to learn that R is built upon an unusually sophisticated programming language.  Its function-calling semantics, for example, are beautiful and eliminate a lot of tedious argument-handling code that most languages force programmers to write.  For a closer look, see this article I wrote just a few weeks ago on the subject:

[Wondrous oddities: R's function-call semantics](http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2006/01/20/wondrous-oddities-rs-function-call-semantics)

If you are looking for a great statistics system for work or play, there is a very good chance that you will find no better than R.

Russell has implemented his "partial programming" concepts in a language called Alisp, an extension of Lisp.
If that's a mistake, then yes, yes I am. My understanding is that the left, in America, is mostly subsumed in progressivism &amp; thus "American Liberalism". 

Not a whole lot of plain old Communists here.
No, not really getting anywhere. I don't disagree with you on any particular point.

I didn't mean "Democrat" when I said "Liberal", but I'm also registered as a Democrat. I would vote for a Republican if I thought that would more likely encourage better government. I think it would be great if there were more politicians who espoused my ideals in a coherent manner. A more coherent manner than Bernard-Henri Lévy found in his search.

I don't think that he's saying we should have more people that pull the "Democrat" lever, or think that every conservative should be dismissed because of their party affiliation. He is asking for a more vigorous discussion of progressive ideas.

Not that I have any personal experience with static-typed languages (they vexxxes usss, precioussss), but I'm pretty sure that OCaml is functional and faster than C right now.

I'm inclined to think that compiler optimizations would be easier in a mostly stateless, functional language.  You'd have a smaller register footprint, freedom to do all the usual instruction-graph-type optimizations, and also the opportunity to do optimizations at the function level.  So that would mean that for small or static data sets, functional code would be faster than C or Fortran.

What you're talking about is a fundamental and inherent shortcoming in the human reasoning process.  It applies to a lot more than just political ideology.

Words are an imprecise way to refer to concepts because words can have multiple meanings.  Much worse, concepts are acquired through experience, and since everyone's experience is different, we're all talking about different (if similar) things, even when we're all using the same words.

So it's not that all those people who *say* they're [patriots/christians/democrats/republicans/superheros] are *lying* to you.  **They believe it**, and they're not deluding themselves.  Sometimes, they do stuff that doesn't fit into *your* definition of what it means to be a [PCDRS], which is what makes you question their sincerity.  But it's their set of definitions that determines how they label themselves, so you have to be careful not to claim to have definitive knowledge about what makes [PCDRS]-es, because everyone who makes the (sincere) statement "I believe I am X" is correct.  It's actually a mathematical fact -- Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem proves it.

Sometimes you can see how tenuous the association between words and experience is by looking at the number of synonyms a given language has for a particular word.  For example, in English we have 3 words for a flowing body of water: brook, stream, and river.  To a first approximation, we use the different words as an indication of size: brooks are small, rivers are big.  In French, on the other hand, there are only two such words.  Roughly translated, they are "river-that-flows-north" and "river-that-flows-south".  To be really pedantic: **different people make different choices when they have to pick out the relevant or defining features of a thing or idea.  French people don't care much about the size of rivers, but do car where they flow.  English rivers flow all over the place, and come in many different sizes.**

In terms of political ideology, people will define Republican-ness, Democrat-ness, etc. differently, depending on their own experiences with Democrats or Republicans.  Superheroists who do 0, 3, and 666 may be trying to decieve you, but it's more likely that they really do think that 666 is an integral part of their (secret) identity as a Superhero, and that 1, 2, and 4 don't matter.  And you can't really argue with them, because 'Superhero' is just a word, and they have as much claim to it as you do.

So we (humans) are kind of screwed, because even though we all experience the same reality, we can't communicate about it reliably, because we can never communicate fully what things inside that reality we want to communicate about.  The communication we do manage is, in fact, the best we can achieve, and most of the political and philosophical turbulence Western society experiences is therefore unavoidable.  If we weren't arguing about our current crop of issues (interventionism, race, fanaticism, money), we'd be arguing about something else (feudalism, protestantism/catholicism, fanaticism, money).  And of course, all the world's whacko fundamentalists out there are experiencing parallel, opposite issues (jihad, secularism-fundamentalism, libertinism, money).

R rocks. I used it to develop factor analysis and portfolio monitoring systems at work (hedge fund trading desk). The statistical libraries of the language have everything you need. R's ability to handle data vectors and matrices in a concise and natural fashion is, in my opinion, better than APL. Like APL, you can generate tremendous expressive power in one line of code. Unlike most APL implementations, R is: open, freely available, easily extendable and equipped with solid I/O. R is basically built on top of a scheme implementation so functions have full lexical closure, etc. A uniquely powerful language for data manipulation.

I agree.  It's a 'survival of the fittest' attitude.  Rich or poor, powerful or weak, arbitrary laws like this lead to social unrest; if working citizens have no confidence that their system administers justice equally for all, it chips away at security of all kinds: economic, familial, and national.

Holy shit, poor dude!
The word 'ideology' is used as an insult throughout the US -- nevertheless, it is doubtful whether one can act politically without acting ideologically as well.

Of course, since the current incumbent of the White House ran on an anti-political ticket, and critics of the administration are often accused of "playing politics", perhaps politics is about to go into the same verbal junkyard as ideology.

However... beware the unpolitical politician, beware the unideological politician.
Where to start?

  "People who can make rational arguments, backed up by   
  solid evidence, should be given their due consideration 
  and respect regardless of what beliefs they adhere to." 
  That is nonsense. 

Substitution necessary to underline the stupidity of the argument that follows.

Baa. Yes, no one has ANY idea what Bush has been up to.

Geez, this guy is definitely from drama school. The Patrick Henry speech is over the top. Get real.

Even if you think Bush is bad, all the checks and balances are still in place, guys. No one is King. We're still allowed to elect our representatives. And last I checked we're still in a democracy. 

If you want to get involved, go ahead. But don't try to make me believe you've got a better form of government around the corner, because you don't.
ideology
One entry found for ideology.
Main Entry: ide·ol·o·gy
Pronunciation: "I-dE-'ä-l&amp;-jE, "i-
Variant(s): also ide·al·o·gy /-'ä-l&amp;-jE, -'a-/
Function: noun
Inflected Form(s): plural -gies
Etymology: French idéologie, from idéo- ideo- + -logie -logy
1 : visionary theorizing
2 a : a systematic body of concepts especially about human life or culture b : a manner or the content of thinking characteristic of an individual, group, or culture c : the integrated assertions, theories and aims that constitute a sociopolitical program

"Being an ideologue has various negative effects, mostly because ideology obscures or alters reality."

You'll have to make a case for 'reality' first. That's to say, it is unclear that it is possible to perceive reality except through the prism of what you call 'ideology', namely, memories, hopes, fears, prejudices, education etc.

We all operate according to an ideology, in the same way that we all perceive reality differently. The difference is that some of us realise it.
actually, if we could have that instead of the annoying intrusive and mostly pointless ground-based "security" we've got now, that might not be a bad trade...
"Words are an imprecise way to refer to concepts because words can have multiple meanings. Much worse, concepts are acquired through experience, and since everyone's experience is different, we're all talking about different (if similar) things, even when we're all using the same words."

Wittgenstein is spinning! How can a concept be understood as a concept except through words? Here's a quote from Philosophical Grammar which you might do well to ponder: " how can one speak of understanding a proposition? Surely it's not a proposition if it can't be understood."
If you would have said thinking for yourself is better than thinking what a bearded man tells you to think, I would have been in reluctant agreement. I find linking (a)theism to murdering, "good" or bad, a weird thing to do.
Isn't the problem simply that American democracy has failed? It has two modes of expression, the Republican and Democratic wings of the capitalist party, and that the ideological spectrum of American life simply cannot be accommodated. The two-party system will inevitably leave many (perhaps most) people totally alienated from the system.
NOOO! This IS the best BLOG!

Yes, about two orders of magnitude less, but 100000 people dead in Iraq, Afghanistan,... are still a lot of dead people.
But to compare with Mao or Stalin, how many of those did Cheney actually murder though? The insurgents aren't following Cheney's orders are they.

Seemed understandable to me, but then I majored in this crap in undergrad. a lot of math is really quite understandable if one is willing to expend some mental effort and a few pages of scrap notes. That it's understandable *with effort* is a big reason why anyone who has a bachelor's degree in math (like me) is considered to be really smart. More often than not, smarts have nothing to do with it. They're simply persistent.

I looks like it might be cool but I dont understand the graph at the bottom or why some of the circles are bigger than others or where the new circles are comming from.
I feel obligated to point out that electronic surveillence did occur under Lincoln, specifically the tapping of electric telegraph lines.

*"Telegraphic duties at military headquarters yielded little in brilliancy and interest compared to those of desperate daring associated with tapping the opponent's wires...Operator William Forster obtained valuable dispatches by tapping the line along the Charleston-Savannah railway..."*  [source](http://www.civilwarhome.com/telegraph.htm)

Now, the George Washington statement, I can't really think of any way to justify. ;-)
The idea sounds very appealing, but I have to say that this destroyed any credibility:

&gt;He takes comfort in the fact that history is replete with cases -- Galileo, Pasteur, Lister -- where paradigm shifts were greeted with hostility.

History is also replete with people who claim that the reason their 'big idea' is not going anywhere is due to the entrenched position of the community.  For every Einstein there are a thousand crackpots quoting Einstein.

Not that it *is* a bad idea, just that the rhetoric is abysmal.
I would understand it as "trust your subconcious mind" or something alike, do not exert 'hard' thinking.
Remember the chemist who got the formula he was looking for during a dream? a snake biting his tail, for the carbone molecule, if I remember well.
People today don't care about liberty because the erosions are small.  If the politicians stay on the current course, that will probably change.  That is, the average joe will start noticing at some point, and then they'll be mad.  It might be 10 or 20 years hence, too.

I think the funniest thing will be the reaction at that future time.  There will be lots of "we told you so's" and a lot of indignation.  The political system will swing the other way, assuming (and this is not certain) it is still possible to throw out the bums.  With electronic voting, who knows?  Many people say it's nuts to think that any political party would tinker with the votes.  The  fact that &gt;50% of the votes in this country are counted on the machines of 2 companies, one of which was run by a person that said he'd work to deliver the electoral votes of OH to GWB...  it no longer seems far fetched that someone might try and steal an election.
It sounds very nice and all, but what about building knowledge of ratios/fractions into our processors next?  We'll still need this for trig and whatnot, but the everyday calculation of rational numbers will be done with the perfect accuracy of a fraction.

Wait, isn't there a language that simulates fractions in its interpreter?  Li-something, ends with a p... Lisp!  That's it!
Boring. I couldn't bear to sit through the guy slowly explaining simple OO principals to get to why this language is different or important. In any case, I'm sure it's another subset of Lisp anyway :)
I'm going to run out and trademark "Mr. Fusion", just in case.  ;-)
more propaganda
My personal opinion: liberals can't fight the power because special interests control this country.

Corporations are naturally right leaning (there are few exceptions to this).  They fund special interests to lobby the government.  Over time, without any balance to the special interests, we've seen the errosion of many things in the US.  Look at health care.  The DCMA.  The entire battle over copyright and intellectual property in this country is being heavily slanted away from the public good and toward corporations.

The other contributing factor is the media: owned by the right.  All the major news organizations in the US are very right leaning.  I can hear the howls now.  But the media is LIBERAL!  Get a grip.  Remember Clinton?  He was roasted over an open flame for getting a blowjob in the Whitehouse.  Now, contrast that with how Bush has been treated.  Bush has received a pass from the US media.  Yeah, there was a little furor over this and that, but not anything approaching what Clinton went through.  Not even close.

So what, the media is right leaning?  Well, it means that Bush, et al, can do a lot of things they wouldn't normally be able to do.  The errosion of liberties.  The huge tax breaks for the rich.  Going to war over a lie.  All this is possible because the media either ignores it or downplays it.  Or, they spin it in the positive, like they do on Fox News.

The special interests + media aligned with corporations = powerless citizens.  That's why the left have disappeared.  They gave up in the face of this.
The article is from 2004, so the idea doesn't seem to have caught on quickly.

Our country is pretty good.  But democracy is not the best system.  You can vote to take money and freedom away from other people, and if enough people are with you, it happens.

Unanimous consent is a better way.  We do it all the time naturally -- your friends vote on what kind of pizza to buy, and if you don't like any of the options, you simply find food for yourself.  They don't make you pay for what you don't want, what you won't eat.  In a democracy, even if you oppose the war in Iraq and illegal wiretaps and so on, you still pay taxes to support them.

It's hard to accept that the other person won, because it's wrong.  There's a difference between not agreeing with how someone runs their own life (not your business) and not agreeing with how they run YOUR life.

But since we are stuck with the democratic process for the conceivable future, I agree, persuasion is the best way.

Interesting development, but I think the "300% more efficient"  is a bit misleading.  It's not overall efficiency of the vehicle, but the storage system itself.

"As Johnson sat behind the wheel of the Expedition, agency officials said the hydraulic hybrid version would get 32 mpg in city driving and 22 mpg on the highway. The conventional gasoline-only Expedition averages 13 mpg in the city and 20 mpg on the highway."

Also, Ford didn't "invent" it, EPA scientists developed the technology, and worked with Ford on the truck.

This introductory article encapsulates four of the top things learned about major enterprise Linux scaling.  These four convey the first rung, or foundational aspects for a robust scaled server complex using Linux.  They also address issues seen fairly consistently in some Linux enterprises.
Fractions are quite a small subset of the reals.  Are there actually any real world tasks which require precise fractions but don't require precise square roots, logs or trig?

If you are curious about what this stuff looks like in practice, the Mathematica system for mathematical computing supports interval arithmetic, and its online documentation shows some examples:

[Mathematica Documentation: Interval](http://documents.wolfram.com/mathematica/Built-inFunctions/NumericalComputation/NumericalPrecision/FurtherExamples/Interval.html)

In particular, interesting stuff happens when you divide by an interval that contains zero:

    In[[7]]  :=  1 / Interval[{-2, 5}]
    Out[[7]] :=  Interval[{-Infinity, -1/2}, {1/5, Infinity}]

Sand Magic!
Artist creates animation with sand
Bush didn´t have much, if anything, to do with this.  7 departments of the federal government spent $1.6 bil on PR firms.

Also, PR firms are a much more respectable (or at least common) practice than "pundit payola" implies.  As I understand it, PR firms disseminate information to the public on behalf of their clients by providing journalists with ideas and outline of articles for print media (amongst other things).  For one perspective, see http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html
From the article, tip number 0 is *Speak what you write:*

&gt; This is rule zero because all other rules follow
&gt; on this.... If you can't speak it naturally,
&gt; rewrite it. Simple.

This is great advice.

When writing in long sessions, however, it is easy to become "snow-blind" such that you cannot see your own mistakes.  Even when you read aloud, you subconsciously correct errors because your brain sees what you intended, not what you actually wrote.

One trick I stumbled across for getting a true reading is to use [The Festival Speech Synthesis System](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) to read my work to me.  That way I know I am hearing exactly what I wrote, and not what I *think* I wrote.

yeah, um, isn't claiming you have a paradigm shift one of the sure signs of a crackpot?
Reminds me of some work I did on an algorithm to reformulate  SQL search criteria as a series of non-overlapping intervals.  The intervals can be executed independently.  And each interval can be run in either direction, allowing the overall task to be further subdivided.  All parts can run in parallel.  Also eliminates need for some conventional indexing.

It does work and ran in a production system.  But I've wanted to do more with the approach.  This article might just get me motivated again.

Money would be a good example.  One of the first things they tell you when joining the financial software industry is "Don't use floats for currency!", and yet everybody does it anyway.  I'm betting that the recurrent complaints I hear about friends missing pennies from their bank statements is all due to round-off error.

The current "best practice" - expressing all currencies in terms of the lowest denomination of that currency - is impractical because there are so many different "lowest denominations".  And they even change: look at the rule change a couple years back that switched NYSE prices from being quoted in 8ths to being quoted in cents.

Fractions would be an ideal fit for exact monetary calculations.

I was actually wondering what it means to be an "honorary professor."  That doesn't seem to imply that he should know what he's talking about.  Also, while prions and chaperones both act by changing the conformation of a protein, I would argue that they are not the same.  A chaperone is coded by the genome of that same individual and is specifically designed to aid in the folding of a particular protein.  Prions, however, are infectious agents that misfold proteins into a nonfunctional conformation.

&gt;For Europeans, scolding the Bush administration for everything from Guantanamo to the Iraq War to secret CIA prisons has become a full-time job. But when it comes to the American scandal over President Bush's warrantless wiretaps, there's been a curious reaction from the other side of the Atlantic: silence. Where is the European outrage?

&gt;European restraint may arise from a fear of hypocrisy. The fact is that in much of Europe wiretapping is de rigueur—practiced more regularly and with less oversight than in the United States. Most Europeans either don't know about this or, more likely, simply don't care.

The European outrage was there and it was about the wiretaps in the US being done **illegally**. It was about Bush and co. being above the law.

Sounds quite interesting; although, "paradigm shift" sounds a bit much...

However, this is rather odd:

&gt; It's so accurate, Walster says, that computer simulations using this
&gt; technique could reduce, and one day even eliminate, the need for
&gt; independent physical verification.

Often, in simulation, the garbage-in-garbage-out principle applies. E.g. in geosciences, computation is not the real problem; setting up the model is. And you couldn't really trust a model without verifiying with real-world data.  (I think there are quite a lot of other fields where this applies as well.)
Bush is the head of the executive branch...he's responsible for EVERYTHING that goes on under the cabinet secretaries.  That's why it's called "The Bush Administration"
That'll make an inspiring mission statement for a school: to ensure that at least 5% of our students know what an embargo is.

If yesterday's illiteracy blesses today's, then clearly the millenium is at hand and we can quit worrying about the schools. If not, maybe we should spare a groan for the Chester Finns who walked 4 miles through snow to plow through the McGuffey's Reader, and then move on.

I come at this body of ideas from studies of perceptual psych an mathematical information theory.  I haven't read Wittgenstein, so this may all be bunk, attributable to a lack of understanding on my part or that of the guy at Wikipedia who wrote the article I'm cribbing from now.  But anyway...

I'm not pretending that my analysis is privileged, that it exists outside the bounding envelope of what is expressable with words, or concepts, or whatever.

I'm just observing that when individual people observe the world, they'll percieve different *aspects* of the totality of the world that they experience, remember only a subset of those perceptions, and everyone will organize (maybe 'index' or 'explain') those memories according to different criteria -- north-flowing-rivers and south-flowing rivers in France, and brooks, streams, and rivers in English.  We all have words that we use to 'process' (to use an innocuous term) our impressions of the world, but since people have different sets of words, they develop different priorities for categorizing things, and those categories are difficult to detect, let alone express, even if you know they're there.

The other interpretation of your question is "how can a concept be understood (i.e. *recognized* among different observers) as a concept."  The answer is shared experience, which works because the concepts we use to describe the external universe don't change the state of the universe itself (although they can change our perceptions thereof... which is another subject altogether).

So the goal is to consciously *create* a shared vocabulary.  A classic example is color.  My idea of what looks 'yellow' could be different from yours because we have divergent experiences of yellowness, but if we can agree on a standard yellow, then we can communicate about yellowness in the future.  We won't, however, have any guarantees that what looks 'yellow' between you and me also looks 'yellow' between me and my upstairs neighbor.  Of course, we have probably been given similar understandings of yellow because we have a common language and culture (thank the crayon companies), but that need not be the case.  For example, when we talk about "purple", we're actualy referring to two different kinds of light, one of which is slightly shorter in wavelength than blue (lavendar, indigo) while the other is made up of a combination of blue and red.

Guess I've written enough.  Does that answer your question?

Bah, feh, and humbug.
First, claiming it's a bigger paradigm shift than anything else, affecting all branches of science, then comparing yourself to Galileo and Pasteur, then claiming how the mainstream "just doesn't get it." It all adds up to, not *that* interesting. 

The big supercomputers are already quite parallel, there was an interesting article a short while ago on a Japanese guy hired to optimize linear math routines. I think the if the approach was so promising, we would have seen more by now. Nonlinear systems are regularly well approximated. What do you think that nice water simulation you looked at was, or your weather prediction each night on the news.

And at its core, I just don't find it that thrilling. The only thing I really see it buying is some predictability on when traditional methods will fail. And even that I find questionable.

Cool, now it's down to 260.  The unthinking hordes are automatically modding down everything I post without looking to see if it's actually interesting.

All you're doing is taking anything with python, lisp, ruby, or the occasional ajax in the title, and posting it in the hopes that it'll gain a couple of karma points.  That's bullshit; your account should be banned.

Even though you must've found a few worthwhile articles (which you probably didn't read) for your karma to be in the hundreds, you're doing more harm than good by flooding the new page with shit, which forces other potentially decent articles into oblivion.  As of now, the new page is half spif, and none of those were posted because anybody thought that they'd be interesting or worthwhile.

Besides, does it really matter when you can simply use an adjective or a description in language X to refer to a single-word concept in language Y?

Freemind is a nice program. A similar cognitive tool is called a 'Concept Map', which has some resemblance to a Mind Map:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_maps
(see 'Contrast with Mind mapping')

As the wikipedia article mentions, there is also a cross-platform tool that lets you draw these at:

http://cmap.ihmc.us/

You can get tons of research papers and such about Concept maps there too.

Rght now, I'm evaluating cmaptools and Freemind, because I just started a new job and need to acquire and organize info rapidly (like who doesn't these days). I haven't made up my mind between the two. Cmaptools has a server option that allows you to share knowledge models with others - but this feature is non-free. The cmaptools client is free for everybody, and can create knowledge models on your hard drive.

Both Freemind and Cmaptools are written in Java.

There is another free Java program called MindRaider which may be useful too. I haven't evaluated this one yet.

This post resonated with me because I have taken so long to realized that my true love is to write. My day job is being an executive assistant but I have started blogging and I'm enjoying my time with it...I've gotten quite a bit of notice in Silicon Valley simply because of my niche, but given the comments that I see on my blog, people seem to enjoy my writing style. And it's that validation that encourages me to work harder; the work doesn't feel like "work". I can be writing posts late into the night and I don't feel exhausted or strained, because I love it and enjoy it. I've even had a few offers to pen articles for a few sites. I have a goal to get out of the assisant work within 2 years and write full time, and hopefully I will accomplish that- taking the 2 job route...yeah I know. Risky but it affords me the time to pursue not only the blogging but other hobbies as well....don't stagnate people...life is too short.

I'm amazed at how sensitive people are modding on reddit.

Just mention looking at cleavage or joke about how difficult it would be to cheat an Indian and people almost take it personal and mod you out of existence.

If you really benefit from an article or comment, mod it up.
If someone REALLY oversteps the bounds, mod it down, BUT get a life and don't overreact because you are personally oversensitive or offended.
I hate to admit it, but this is really true.  It's incredibly annoying to be talking to a guy about a problem, and have him suggest an obvious solution.  I immediately suspect he either doesn't think I'm very intelligent or doesn't care what I'm saying, and thus become wary about discussing problems with him in the future.

Come on, this article is just loaded. They weren't exactly "killing innocent creatures trapped in a pen with no hope of escape."

&gt; The official story then has Cheney blaming the victim, saying it was the victim's fault he got in Cheney's way.

So not only is this article loaded, but its wrong as more than one observer said that it wasn't Cheney's fault (the words didn't come from Cheney).

&gt; And, of course, they couldn't afford to admit the truth, because the truth would probably be an impeachable offense.

And then it drifts from loaded and ignorant to pure nonsense.

To most men, asking for help is a MAJOR thing to do. It's private, you ask your best friend you have, and the other man will instantly recognize it for what it is: A plea for help, which shouldn't be talked about outside the intimate forum just established. Girls, I've been told, apparently find this quite strange.

From the other side of the fence: It's incredibly irritating to be listening to a woman with a problem, and have her not seeing an obvious solution. I immediately suspect she either doesn't think or doesn't care what she's saying, and thus become wary about listening to her problems in the future.

What i don't understand is, why women do this. Communications fails most of the time anyway, so why make it more complicated by not mentioning the intention directly? Just to constantly test the empathy of men?

Men believe more in trust than in constant testing. That's why we forget Valentines Day and other annual things. They just don't matter for something like trust. Trust is earned by extraordinary doings not by buying some flowers.

They don't have to translate the game's storyline into a movie, the game's universe is rich enough to create a brand new story.
Not really. 

&lt;p&gt;The point is (and it is similar to much of what you've written, without agreeing) that to speak of something as a 'concept' implies recognition, or tacit agreement on the bases of conversation. Wittgenstein's question about a proposition (typically mischievous) is that a "proposition" (that is, a statement that proposes something), cannot be a proposition (i.e. propose anything) unless it is understood. If it is not understood, obviously enough, it cannot propose anything and therefore cannot be a proposition.

&lt;p&gt;I was applying a similar logic to the idea that we are all lonely solipsists gnawing on the marrow-bones of our personal universes and seeking (pathetically) to communicate with others. It is a modern truism that such communication is faulty, partial, etc etc.

&lt;p&gt;This is not necessarily the case -- you posit the treatment of bodies of moving water as an example, yet your lucid explanation of this in two different languages and cultures somewhat gives the lie to our melancholy solipsistic fate.

&lt;p&gt;You suggest that "the goal is to consciously create a shared vocabulary" and give the example of colour. I suggest that the shared vocabulary already exists, by virtue of the fact that communication exists, and that it makes no sense to speak of concepts without having that shared vocabulary already existing and in some sense agreed upon.

&lt;p&gt;By the way, colour is the oldest example in the book, and  I have a question for you: if we all perceive colours differently, why (Germans aside) do we have a relative consensus on which colours go well together?

If you think this story isn't go to go away you're drinking the Kool-Aid. The story will fade because (and here's the crucial part) **while it's a good metaphor for Cheney in general, it has no bearing on whether or not he does his job**. So, basically those who think Cheney sucks will have more "proof" and those like Cheney will say, "mistakes happen." Whoop-di-do.

In other words, Google Book Search is a valuable service to publishers and authors that Google is currently offering gratis.  

This makes me think of a new business model for Google: publishers that object to the Google Book Search won't be scanned, but can later *pay* Google on a book-by-book basis to be added to the index after all.  In other words, inclusion in the index would be a service Google offers publishers for a fee, but it waives the fee if the publisher gives them carte blanche (because it saves Google to cost of maintaining the opt-in list for that publisher).

Slight meta tag overkill, IMHO.

You're already putting in a robots.txt and a fav icon, there's really no point or advantage to reiterating it in on every freaking page.

Few search engines use meta data anymore anyway, at this point it's really just a waste.
balls kicking sounds good, everything else would be the "technical solution to the social problem" something that may not fare well ;)
This is a fantastic article and exposes the filth and lies of the Blair government
"''Julia went on to describe how she and the other girls actually witnessed Rajanna microwave one of the aborted fetuses and stir it into his lunch,'' explained Howard, the investigating officer in the case. ''Julia claimed that she shared this (information) with some of the other employees, who confirmed that they had seen him do the very same thing.''

Howard was so disturbed by the charge that he took Garcia to see Tomasic. Though Howard warned Garcia that lying to a district attorney would be a serious offense, she reportedly told the same story to Tomasic.

But Tomasic's hands were tied. There were no laws on the books to prohibit an abortionist – or anyone else – from eating a human unborn baby."
Mostly sarcasm, there was such a study but I forget whether it applies or whether that matters at all.

I disagree that the Hitchhiker's Guide stands alone as a piece of comedy writing, because it was actually a radio show in the first place. Adams was good at radio shows because the listeners had to supply the visuals themselves, and the book and TV show similarly left a good amount to the imagination. But it's difficult to have a big-screen, high-def movie that leaves so much out.
Riiiiight.  And this is reported by an incredibly unbiased, impartial source, is it?  Look at http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=44777 (an article linked-to from this one) for a good idea of their real bias.

Phrases like "a typical pond-scum abortionist", "the cold blood coursing through Rajanna's veins must have impaired his brain function" and the awesomely unimpartial start to the article:

"It is so hard to find a good abortionist these days. Most seem to meet with one of three professional demises: imprisonment for sexual assault; medical license revocation for malpractice; or death, alone in their beds, while watching porn flicks after overdosing on heroin."

This is unsourced hatchet-job BS from a blatantly anti-abortion writer.  Avoid.

I agree, it is a lot funnier this way.

Interestingly enough, this is also considered a very good way to deal with children (I'm not implying that women are childish!).  Often, children simply want acknowledgement of their feelings, but parents will tell them that they shouldn't feel the way they do, or offer solutions, which discourages the child from finding solutions to problems him/herself.

Denial of feelings happens more often with boys, which may help explain this communication gap between women and men.

When a child's bad feelings are accepted, they can let go of them.  But when they are denied, the child bottles up the bad feelings, which causes much bigger problems.  It's extremely common in the public school system, too.
Men are trained to hide their emotions and only communicate concrete information.  Women learn to communicate their emotions.  The emotion is direct, it's just that us men are mis-interpreting the message by filtering out the emotional information.
&gt; Yeah, well you're spamming reddit. In the past three hours, you've submitted 50 articles. I don't see how the hordes are any more unthinking than you, considering that you haven't even read the articles you've submitted.

Actually I did read the ones that I hadn't already read at a previous date.  I'm a speed reader.  Not that most redditors thoroughly read every article they post, but I bothered to anyway even though it's basically only an unwritten rule that you should do so.

&gt; All you're doing is taking anything with python, lisp, ruby, or the occasional ajax in the title, and posting it in the hopes that it'll gain a couple of karma points. That's bullshit; your account should be banned.

That was a little experiment I was doing to see whether people would mod things down even if they were interesting, just because they decided I was "spamming" by posting "too much".  I don't really understand how you can post too much if everything you post is interesting, but hey, that was part of the experiment.

The other part was to test what the response would be if someone just wrote a bot that read in RSS feeds and posted them to reddit.  I think if I randomized the feed selection and the timing well enough, no one would be able to tell the difference between the bot and your average redditor.  Basically all they're doing is getting feeds from popular blogs and news sites, or constantly checking those sites, and then posting whatever new items come up that are vaguely interesting.  That would include trolling populicious and delicious recent.  That's certainly what I do, and it works pretty well, like I said.

And that is why I think reddit could be replaced by just adding comment threads to delicious or populicious.  This is pretty much what Newsvine [ http://www.newsvine.com/ ] is doing anyway.  I'm toying with the idea of writing some kind of mashup that pulls from reddit, delicious, populicious and some other sites, and averages/combines/compares them.  But I'm sure someone else could do it better than I would anyway, so there's not much point when I don't have a good high-bandwidth platform to support it if it were to be successful.  There are already some crude examples like reddiggdot.us anyway, which BTW is also a good source for things to crosspost to reddit.

My karma is almost back up to 450, so I guess it all worked out in the end.  Thanks for participating in my experiment.

BTW this comment is also part of the experiment.  Let's see how you react.

&gt; This sounds like fine advice if you want to be her best friend and forfeit the possibility of ever having sex with her.

Huh?  First off, the article is a guide to talk to women you already know and would care to talk to.  It's not a "How To Pickup Women", which I agree works completely differently, though you seem to have missed the actual point of the article entirely.  

However, for talking to a woman (say your wife/girlfriend who you ARE sleeping with) or just a co-worker who you are friendly with and may not even have the faintest desire to sleep with, this advice DOES work.  In fact, the woman who I have just married was the first person ever able to explain this to me directly.  She didn't want my analysis (which might be something that I want when talking to someone about a situation), but she wanted me to commiserate and identify with what she's feeling.  (And that's all she wants.)  No suggestions as to what she could have done better, just "That's too bad, I understand completely how you feel."
Of course, the other possibility is that the parent really was content free and so nobody found it beneficial or helpful, *in addition* to be offensive.

I'm all for rude, insensitive, or offensive jokes, but they gotta be funny or at least have some redeeming value to them.  Useless + offensive = mod down, useless + benign = leave be, funny + offensive = mod up, useful = mod up regardless of how offensive it is.
I love the Internet. I totally remember john saying "It's out 1800th show!" and looking off-camera, but i didn't get it. And low and behold I get the backstory.

Oh come on, no-one is convinced by your crap about your comment being part of "the experiment".  That's just an excuse so that if someone out-argues you, you can simply disclaim responsibility for parts of your message as you so choose, putting them down as some kind of "psychological experiment".

&gt;Actually I did read the ones that I hadn't already read at a previous date. I'm a speed reader.

That's hard to believe; given that you admit to just stealing links from other news sites, it seems hardly likely that you read them all.  Perhaps you just post them anyway, without much regard for what you think will be appreciated by the reddit community.

Maybe this is just a difference in how you and I look at a resource such as reddit.  You seem to see it as some sort of competition, and to take it for granted that submitters are out to rack up karma, rather than to contribute to the community:

&gt;Not that most redditors thoroughly read every article they post, but I bothered to anyway even though it's basically only an unwritten rule that you should do so.

However, I don't think that you should post something unless you feel that it'll really be appreciated.  Difference of perspective, perhaps.

As for your claim that reddit could be replaced by adding comment threads to del.icio.us, I disagree.  I think there's a fairly unique community here.  I don't read del.icio.us, so I couldn't highlight differences for sure, but it seems to me that there are key differences in the communities.  Reddit has a variety of interesting articles from all areas of interest, but it is more tech-oriented than most collaborative aggregators.  However, it is no slashdot (I know slashdot isn't collaborative, I'm making a point about the communities here), and it accommodates people whose minds do occasionally stray beyond the bounds of their computers.  For me and, I imagine, many others, this is ideal, and is something I have been unable to find anywhere else on the web.

Plus, reddit has a better site design and logo than del.icio.us
Some of you may not be familiar with the Haiku operating system, Haiku began its life when Be Inc. the company behind BeOS went bust in 2001, and its intellectual property was sold to Palm, Inc. Haiku's goal is to recreate and exstend upon Be Inc's latest released version of BeOS, version R5.

I think the different brands are necessary for marketting.  Would the H2 or Escalade be as popular if they wern'e made by Hummer or Oldsmobile?  But then again this is a result of GM weakening its own brand.
I definitely understand that argument, and you're right it's phrased in terms of permission rather than being forbidden outright. But IMO grouping homosexuality with "substance abuse," just to take one example from the agreement, is asking for trouble to say the least.

Yet the idea didn't entirely die. If you compare literate programming to acceptance testing framework Fit, there are some clear parallels. While literate programming remains a tiny niche idea, Fit has carved a significant mindshare.

So perhaps literature and programs weren't as analogous as Knuth thought. But the verification tests for a program? Now there are some facts for human consumtion, a clear space where literate programming could flourish. It did, but with common office apps instead of TeX.

....

Cartman:  [through the headphones] All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."

....

Cartman: All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful."

....


Shawna:\t"And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."

Jimmy:\t"if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.

Shawna:\tYou know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.

Jimmy:\tReally?

Shawna:\tYeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do.

If you, say, had del.icio.us tag **reddit**, and anyone that wanted to post or vote on a link for the "delicious reddit" just tagged it as **reddit**, then the reddit community could exist without the buggy reddit code (not that delicious is perfect, mind you - maybe delirious instead?).  You could do the same thing on Newsvine once it goes public.  But then you wouldn't have the 31337 p0w4h 2 pwnz0r p0stZ by disliking them.  So I guess that wouldn't work.

w00t.

As far as not viewing karma as a competition:  what's the point then?  Why have a stats page?  If reddit has any advantage over other aggregators, it's that right now there is at least a small hardcore group of people who are competing for karma.  Most of them just won't put it in your face quite as hard when they win.  I wanted to see what would happen if I did, and I found out.  But don't fool yourself, it's still a competition whether the players are comfortable admitting it or not.

And as far as only posting things that I feel will really be appreciated:  that's exactly what I'm trying to do!  I'm posting as many things that I appreciate, and that I feel others will appreciate, as I possibly can!  Just because I'm a hyper prolific poster doesn't mean I don't read or care about the content that I'm posting links to.  The attitude that I must be a "spammer" posting worthless things if I post more than one or two at a time is exactly what I'm exploring in my experiment.

BTW, you are helping my experiment tremendously, thank you.  And I'm not using that term as a shield or to demean anyone.      You are all very important to the experiment and I hope we can all learn how to improve reddit through this experience.

Grow up. Not wanting to have sex with you isn't because you can listen to her problems.

The one thing I'd like to add is Peter F. Hamilton. Night's Dawn would *so* kick ass. There are at least a couple of potential movies right there, and with a universe so rich you could have several series. *twitches* Ah, one can hope...

Yeah, HHGttG might be impossible to do since it won't compare to the book directly, it just won't. There've been two tries that I know of that work well enough but just not the same way. The radio series is also much different from the book, but at least it has the leeway to work in the same sort of way...

why does his audience not know what an SDK is?

You know, it is possible even if nobody gets ripped off.  That's the whole idea of relative value at work, and it's the whole basis behind the free market.

Maybe person A values a paperclip more than a pencil, and person B does the reverse.  If they trade, they're both winners.  This can go on and on, it's just a matter of finding people with the right relative values along the way.

Of course, in this case part of the value includes fame, which accelerates the process.
Thunderlizards?  Must people invent needless cutesy words for basic ideas?  

And the reasn his audiences needs "SDK" explained: They're marketers, so they have little to no undersanding of "software" or "development". 

Which, now that I think of it, explains the need to invent needless cutesy words for basic ideas.
I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, but it wasn't really all that interesting. Plastic bins move around, workers put items in them, and they get packed and shipped.
ditto.
I don't agree with this, but I modded it up because it's interesting and takes a point of view that should be considered.  I think it's important to define what a blog is because of the hype surrounding blogs and every new product or company in the web space trying to attach itself to that hype in some way.

Per Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog ):

&gt; A blog is a website in which items are posted on a regular basis and displayed in reverse chronological order.

That's a pretty good basic definition.  Why get all angsty and stuff about defining what it is, as long as there is plenty of breathing room in the definition?

I have unlearned cursive, except for my signature, almost by purpose but mostly by atrophy.  I write everything in horrible scrawled print, but mostly I type - on a cramped but 31337 Happy Hacking Keyboard (w00t) and my BlackBerry 7100t's cramped but 31337 thumbboard.

But I think in the future we will be using more haptics, waving our hands around to do cyber-magick, some voice (but not too much reliance on voice because what happens when you can't talk?), and eventually some direct neural input.

Oh Boy, another self-promoting blogger on Social Networking site.

On behalf of those who enjoy reading the 'New' page, I'd like to ask that you stop "experimenting" on it.  It might be fun for you to post 50 links in the space of a couple hours, but hundreds of real people are having to sort through the mountains of crap.  

Karma is not a competition, it reflects (among other things) how much respect you show the rest of the community.  If it dropped hundreds of points when you started flooding reddit with links, that's supposed to tell you something.  If you must treat the reddit community as your personal lab rats, please at least throttle back on the flooding - it degrades the experience for everyone.

It's not fun, it's a lot of work to read that much.  And is it really crap?  I guess we'll find out.

&gt; Karma is not a competition, it reflects (among other things) how much respect you show the rest of the community.

So again, why is there a stats page?  And why does it only list the top 10 in certain categories?  It's like the top scores on an arcade game.

&gt; If it dropped hundreds of points when you started flooding reddit with links, that's supposed to tell you something.

It did.  It told me that I need to randomize the timing and subjects of my posts in order to avoid triggering an irrational "anti-spam" reaction from redditors.

&gt; If you must treat the reddit community as your personal lab rats

That's not it at all.  I'm trying to get a better understanding of how it works so I can help make it better.    BTW, I also submit bug reports to the redditmasters on a regular basis and they frequently lead to substantial code fixes.  So I'm giving back, not taking away.

&gt; please at least throttle back on the flooding

That's what I'm working on right now.

&gt; On behalf of those who enjoy reading the 'New' page

How's that work, BTW?  Maybe we should have elected representatives, but to my mind if anyone speaks for reddit it's the redditmasters.  I'd love to hear what they have to say about it.

hard to read
In my opinion, being able to vote submissions down is important.  For example, if an article makes strong points about a topic, so many people who agree with it vote it up, but you think that it is invalid or flawed in some way, overlooking facts for the sake of stating a particular viewpoint, you'd want to vote it down.  Essentially, it gives greater opportunity to the users of the site to put forward their views on an article, rather than having to either bookmark it as a mark of their approval, or to abstain without putting forward their negative vote.  And, yeah, if something is overdone or uninteresting, it feels good to vote it down.  All reddit does is to collate the opinions of the users; chances are that people who vote something down simply because they disagree with it will have their votes overidden by the majority if the article is worthwhile.

A bit of healthy competition with the karma might be a good thing; sure, it's satisfying to see that others think that your submissions are worthwhile.  But when it becomes so important to gain karma that you just post any old thing on the off-chance that it'll be voted positively, that just gets annoying.  That's another reason for the negative votes.

I'm not convinced that you feel that most of what you have posted is worthwhile, but I can't very well prove otherwise, so I'll just have to take you on your word and have faith in the fact that the system will take care of itself.

If you're serious, maybe you should write your experiment up as a paper and submit it.  I'll vote it up, I promise :)
Google "Kuhn Structure Scientific Revolutions" and start reading.  The book's full of holes, but it's incredibly important for educated people to read anyway.
Actually I was thinking about it, and you could vote something down on delicious or a similar system, by deleting your post of the URL.  This is actually what goes on now on delicious, really.  I just wasn't thinking it through earlier.

The thing is, it makes it less likely that you will vote capriciously, at least if you use delicious a lot.  If you vote something up, that means you like it enough to keep the post in your delicious cloud forever, to have it on your delicious blogroll, etc.  If you vote something down, it means you don't care if you have it in delicious so you can go back to it later.

Sure, you can't give something an overall negative score that way, but the system could allow you to set a baseline score as a pref.  So if something is tagged **reddit**, then after it's been posted for a certain period of time, if it still has a score less than, say, 15, it will appear as a negative.  If it goes below 5 or 10 you won't see it at all.  There could actually be a set of personal thresholds you could customize for this behaviour.

Karma is important, but I wouldn't post "any old thing" just to get it.  I understand very clearly that that can lead to the opposite effect.  But what I find interesting is that even though I wasn't just posting "any old things", the fact that I was posting so many interesting things all at once triggered the "anti-spam" reaction.  A negative reaction to a high *quantity* of postings within a certain timeframe actually led a subset of redditors to refuse to objectively evaluate the *quality* of the postings.

I am very much convinced that everything I posted was worthwhile.  I have respect for reddit and I wouldn't want to post anything that I haven't read and enjoyed myself.  I just read and enjoy things a little faster than most, and I've read and enjoyed a lot of things in the past.  I'm very serious about this and I will be writing up the results of my experiment.  I'm still trying to figure out how I will do that and post it without it being reflexively modded down by the redditors who hate virtually any blog and/or meta posts.  But I'll sort it out eventually :-)

&gt; if the approach was so promising, we would have seen more of it by now...

People were saying that about Pyra and Craigslist a few years ago.  It's not like they represent new technology.

Control theory is a lot more important than most people realize -- it's what puts the "precision" in precision manufacturing.  Which gives us better microchips, faster CPUs, fuel cells (?), faster prototyping, and *especially* cheaper manufacturing.
I don't know why we do this, but I wouldn't say it's some sort of test.  I completely agree that trust is one of the most important things in a relationship.  However, I'd say that feeling comfortable enough to talk about my problems to a guy is a big sign of trust.  I guess guys just communicate differently...they're so mysterious...

Seriously.  What a vacuous article.
The authors of this article are *SO* clueless it makes me want to spit.  Solar Cells are good for the environment in the same way that ice cream can be low fat.

reddit may have a positive feedback loop which would make it run away in one direction or another. If one category of user outweighs all others pretty soon only content favored by those users would rise to the top and other users would lose interest.

Someone should write a simulator for that (and then submit an article about it to reddit, of course)
ITS ABOUT PAUL GRAHAM FOR GODS SAKE JUST CLICK ON THE UP ARROW!!!
Yes, it shows how the irrationality of agents in a free market can be used for personal gain.
He gives constructive criticism of YCombinator, which is more than saying "YCombinator has flaws."  He lists what the flaws are.  It's significant because reddit readers tend to be Paul Graham followers.

Re "No minor accidents when you are on a bike" -- I won't argue against the statistical fact that motorcycling is much more dangerous than driving, but if you're wearing proper safety gear it is indeed possible to have a minor accident. I've demonstrated this a couple times :)

Duh.  The implied point was that the 'hide' is not used.  It is out of the sight line of the promote/demote arrows.
Hahaha...I'm sure the phenomenon is the same on digg.  But digg is established as a "Technology news website," where reddit is "What's new online?"  

Reddit doesn't have an expectation from the creators as to what subject matter will be submitted.

"Get some competitors" isn't really constructive criticism. The only other suggestion is to invest different amounts of money. But the author ignores why YC invests that amount of money -- it's to give the programmers enough to live comfortably for three months while they build a prototype.

Are you a Reddit asshole? Or like 30dollarwatch, are you just a plain old-fashioned asshole. I especially love this quote.... "but I think most of the 'over-demoters' are intent on rating every single post to their own standard".
When rating posts I had originally meant to rate according to 30dollarwatch's standard, or better yet, a politically-correct United Nations approved "unbiased" standard, but I got lazy and just used my own standard. I'm sure 30dollarwatch is correct, and most of us "assholes" base our opinions on our own standards. People like 30dollarwatch remind me of Austin Power's father, to paraphrase "There are only two things in this world I cannot stand; people who are intolerant of other cultures, and the Dutch".

Causation and correlation are so screwed up in this article.  It insults my intelligence.

For example, if you don't want people to get HIV/AIDS then there are one hundred ways to get them to do so that are better than stopping purchases of diamonds.  

Not buying diamonds will just mean that mine workers will have HIV/AIDS *and* be out of a job.  If you continue to buy diamonds, then they will at least have a job so they can purchase the expensive treatment necessary to live.

Agreed.  I just thought it was ironic and worth a submission.

The event is designed to feature prominent members of society delivering several prepared addresses, and is part of a larger initiative to formally declare invalid the prevailing economic and political paradigms currently in place in the United States.
Duluth, MN (PRWEB) January 30, 2006 — A group of distinguished experts and scholars, including Robert M. Bowman, James H. Fetzer, Wayne Madsen, John McMurtry, Morgan Reynolds, and Andreas von Buelow, have concluded that senior government officials have covered up crucial facts about what really happened on 9/11.
It was a real anticlimax when he finally got to the criticism.   It seemed like he was going to really show us the dirt when he started out with "I don’t think Paul Graham has malicious intent or is intrinsically evil...".  Kind of a disappointing "critique", if you can call it that.

They're not being irrational, they just value the enjoyment of being part of this experiment more than the difference in their valuations of the objects they're trading.

You could argue that they're acting on incomplete information.  If someone decides that participating wasn't worth it after all, their negative experience will become part of their "information" so they don't make the same mistake again.  All in all, this is a really interesting economics experiment.

The article is mostly an apology for criticising Paul Graham, without much criticism. Seriously let loose, I bet he can take it. As it is, the article looks more like a (succesful) attempt to get onto reddit's front page.
In simple terms, Interval Arithmetic isn't a paradigm shift
and there are several reasons for that.
It was explicitly mentioned back to 1962 and the first roots can be traced even to 1924.
First, it hasn't found a target group yet.
Financial and business arithmetic need only BCD-based, arbitrary-precision arithmetic. They have well-defined values, mostly basic operations (addition,multiplication) and the operations like power (for interests) which can 
produce infinite-length results can be rounded elegantly.

Numbercrunching fields like simulations, FEM etc. are (there is no other words for it) addicted to performance. They
are using the latest equipment and are exclusively programming in imperative and machine-near languages like
FORTRAN (the majority), C (or even assembly, but this is AFAIK rare). If you know these languages, you know what people are sacrificing on languages to get a fraction more speed.
They are absolutely reluctant to sacrifice 5% speed for higher accuracy, 50% like interval arithmetic is intolerable. They drop it, no discussion.
Now to physics or other fields: Interval arithmetic has several weaknesses which handicapped its use.
tmoertel has given one example: If you have a zero contained
in the interval, you get something like the dreaded [-Inf, Inf] result. Fine, that the result is between the two infinities was obvious before the calculation.
Several other problems:
The interval error increases linearly: [0,2] + [1,3] = [1,5]
The error interval is the sum of the error interval of both terms. But every physicist knows that this is simply not
a good approximation; the error function is concentrated mostly in a gauss-shaped curve and errors tend to cancel each other. You get a ridiculously bloated error interval after some hundred operations.
Another problem are periodical (or multi-valued) functions. Draw the sinc function = sin (x) / x (which is harmless) and you get a curve with different maxima and minima. An interval implementation must find out the maximum and minimum of each function which are commonly used in physics and if you have an already bloated result, it will be distorted even more.
But I admit that interval arithmetic has its merits if you have a mathematical problem where precision is not a problem
and where the behaviour of the problem with must be solved and studied in a machine.

The simulations just cover a rupture from the Salton Sea to San Bernadino. 

The Tejon segment has a rupture average of 150 years and it's overdue as well. Conceivably, one segment rupture could trigger the other segment rupture.
KICK...ASS....  I've tried to do this before and quickly failed, and before this has even scrolled off the new page I now have a perfectly running instance. Thanks sustern.
I'd expect this from TomsHardware a la the "let's get our government sponsored tour of a chinese computer fab plant. Wow! Look at all the happy workers." It's a fucking warehouse. I've worked in warehouses that distributed toilet parts. They all look the same. Amazing!
you're showing your /. heritage. reddit needs a more expressive point system for this reason. people dont just read posts for a dumb *high score*. They might skip funny posts for insightful or informative. 

So in this sense these forums have a long way to go to be useful.
Ohh but wouldn't it be cool!

Where do I go to change said preference?  I couldn't find it in the article, nor can I find it in the Firefox preferences.
Interval arithmetic and arbitrary-precision rationals are completely different, unrelated things. You can use both of them together just fine. RTFA.

Also, Lisp doesn't "simulate fractions in its interpreter". It does arithmetic on rationals, and this usually happens in compiled code. And the feature is available in quite a few other (not very mainstream) languages as well.
Heres my take on the  [**VC's**](http://www.paulgraham.com/vcsqueeze.html) (blood sucker) response:

&gt; *'... YCombinator invests about $6,000 per founder. ...'* 

So I and others have no chance of making any money off you


&gt; *'... Since there is rarely any competition for these deals (you either take money from YCombinator ) or you don`t), its hard to assess whether the valuation is fair or not. ..'*

I dont know if I can make more money off you.


&gt; *'... Basically, at a micro-level, YCombinator has almost zero ...competition. ... When there is an imbalance of power, there is the potential for the weaker party to get screwed. ...'* 

There's no way I can bargain against yCombinator ... I'm the weaker party


&gt;  *'... I'm hoping that more 'very early stage' investors will fill the capital gap for the next generation of software startups. ...'

Sh*t I hope this doesn't catch on. I'll be out of a job.

It's a shame we don't hear more moderate Muslim voices in the mainstream media. Pieces like this, if they got more airtime on TV and on radio, may do wonders towards fostering understanding in the Western world about the causes of Islamic extremism. It makes me so sad that our governments continually turn a blind eye to any of the root causes of terrorism, focussing only on ridiculous notions of them "hating our freedom". Instead trusting that force of arms and perceived righteousness will carry the day and lead the world to peace. But what can we do when no one wants to listen?
The article was a very interesting post.

On the neural map of enlightenment, the author does a good job of explaining the synaptic drop with regard to the amygdala; But the part on the changes to the hippocampus was quite difficult to grasp even after a couple of readings. 

Hi Mike thanks for the resonse. When you mentioned the script I was thinking something complicated along the lines of db-&gt;[wiki](http://tron09.com/wiki/2006_February)-&gt;script-&gt;[cal](http://tron09.com/calendar/2006/02/). 

But what you describe is too easy :)
&gt; So how do I access browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers"
&gt; to edit the value??
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; Open up a blank window, then go to the 'address' 
&gt; about:config. Then scroll down until you find it.

Or just type "max" to filter the list
Read between the lines. If you set browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers to a small value like 2 or 3 you reduce FF's memory usage by half or more.

Read this comment:

"Ben my man, that worked. FF went from hogging 250MB of my ram to a swift 54MB with the same tabs and page clicks. Where were you 5 months ago ;)"
I disagree, I think a UI shouldn't put search prompts where they don't belong, so for me it IS a UI issue.
useless redundant and neverending
I don't know about you, but the reason I rated it as significant was that if similar articles show up, I'd like to see them.  Though reddit's UI makes this woefully unclear, the purpose of the up and down arrows is not to say "yay" or "boo" but to train a filter.

It's a shame the UI doesn't make this clearer, because this is a really significant difference between reddit and digg.  At digg you do just say "yay" or "boo," whereas at reddit you might mod up an article you disagreed with, if it was interesting in the sense that you'd like to see more like it.

You don't understand. Our leaders are doing the same, they just don't go to the extremes. They need a common enemy too, to divert the public eye from their own failures inside their own countries.
Not sure if its good form to reply to comments or not, but will take the liberty of doing so.

The article was really intended to capture some thoughts (both good and bad) about YCombinator from a founder's perspective (in fact, all of my articles at onstartups.com are directed at software founders).

So, the idea was to try and provide some minimal education to those that might not quite understand the dynamics.

I hadn't expected the article to get the visibility it did and really had no intention of trying to claim a position on the home page.

My writing style, even when I'm critical, tends to be more "balanced" (which some would classify as overly polite).  Not trying to sound apologetic, but I find it hard to criticize strongly unless I really passionately believe that the criticism is accurate and warranted.

In YCombinator's case, I really do think they're providing a great alternative to startup founders.  My grip is that there aren't more investors out there doing this kind of stuff (thereby giving founders more choices).

My focus is on founders (and not on Paul or YCombinator).

There is good music out there that is published by RIAA companies, and I hear it while I'm out or listen to it on the radio from time to time. But I don't buy their CD's. With all that they've done, they've just made me not want to buy their CD's.

I would like the ability to listen to the music I like whenever I want. And I think finding music I like has a luck or mood component involved, and I just haven't got into independent music much yet. Right now I live in a place that doesn't have a very big music scene.

But if I just keep the views I have now, I am sure that in the future I'll often stumble upon some independent music I like. I hope that a lot of others are in the same situation I am, and that more and more popular bands in the future will be non-RIAA.

And the only thing to make it so I no longer "just don't want to buy RIAA music" would be for the RIAA to start doing things ethically.

I think its perfectly good form to reply - have at it ol' chap. 

If you need to start an article with 'I don’t think Paul Graham has malicious intent or is intrinsically evil' you except a little bit more passion. 

You have background in start ups so I'd like to hear more about how you think $6K investment (with a market cap around $100-$200K) is too low. Sounds like a reasonable argument to make, but you don't back it up much and you couch it in cautious/self-doubting language.

You can be passionate about something without being for or against it, just explore it with more gusto.
This is just plain out-and-out dumb.  Though that may only be my opinion, because I have rather good script.
So, perhaps the furor over the cartoons is an attempt to discredit the Danish government and their impartiality as head of the UN Security Council?
Well, since ["fair use"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) has a specific legal meaning, you can easily look it up and see that it's not really related to the more dubious matter of general archival rights.

How is going to the shop, buying and installing RAM easier than changing the value of one setting in your browser?
I agree that reddit's UI needs to make this more clear. I think may people are voting up and down based on if they agree with the article or comments.  I've rated a lot of stories based on what I like to see, and lately I've been disappointed, I notice that I am not enjoying reddit as much as I once did. I realize now that I look at 'hot' topics, and probably should be looking only at 'recommended'. I'll see if that improves my experience on the site.

You really want to make a moral equivalence to "honour killings of girls, oppression of women, female genital mutilation, polygamy"??? You don't say who your leaders are that you speak of but I bet the worst of them don't condone such things. 

There are VERY few true leaders in power around the Western world. A good deal of the reason for this is because of attitudes like yours that are self-hating and make excuses for intolerable acts by repeating the kindergarten mantra of "he did something bad too" to deflect blame and support a stupid and pointless political argument. 

How can true leaders with real moral standards ever win support if the electorate consists of people with attitudes like yours? In that respect our societies have very similar problems as the muslims. If we all remain apathetic then we get this malaize and will continue to regress and devolve into an ignorant mob. Time to demand higher standards.
Postgres has had geospatial support for years but its not part of the base system, its an external extension freely available and widely supported. Same goes for replication options. There are excellent and several replication options for Postgres - to the point that choosing only one or implementing yet another in the main product would more than likely result in fewer options for users rather than a benefit. It would be a mistake to count these as disadvantages for Postgres which is a problem with check box comparisions. Postgres also has Python as an embedded language in addition to the ones already listed and is presently at version 8.x.

I'm not knocking MySQL here (its certainly been improving) but just intend to clarify things I know and have experience with.
I was also surprised by this fact. I think it is a very rational explanantion for some of the reactions and should have been mentioned by mainstream media.

The assumption that men and women communicate differently, while likely true in many cases, is so often used as an excuse to treat the other sex as some sort of mysterious riddle that I can't help but think it's only contributing to the problem.  Blindly relying on advice like this seems like a wonderfully easy way to avoid trying to understand someone's individual way of operating, and an excuse for both of you to continue using a broken communication system.

If you want advice, you should learn to say that clearly.  If you only want to vent, you should learn to say that too.  And if you don't know which the other person wants, it seems pretty clear to me that you should just ask them, politely and respectfully.  FlyingAvatar's wife seems to be able to handle this, so congratulations to you both, sir!
O.K., I've run the experiment. Recommended is much better for me than 'hot' topics. Recommended correctly suggested I might like a day old story that only had 1 karma point. I now realize a serious UI error on the Recommended page. IMHO Recommended should NOT display the Karma points. Recommended should display something else, perhaps a percentage from 1 to 99% that Reddit believes I will like the story. Reddit on the new and hot pages has taught me to not click on stories with low Karma points. This is a hard habit to break on the Recommended page where Reddit is in fact selecting stories it thinks I will like, so I haven't been clicking on the low Karma score stories. A simple fix to this page might also help train people on the remaining pages that the goal is to teach reddit what your like.
I really like FIT, I love the idea. Its all about validating things in plain language. Its quite nice. I guess it makes sense that the 2 concepts gelled nicely in my mind. Never thought of FIT like that.
I'd like to see good articles posted comparing the two, but this was little more than a comparison chart, which I don't see as very useful.

I agree.  I've been telling them (since about August) that they should do this for every link, not just on recommended but on the front page too.
I think it gives a fairly good general overview of the two servers.  I agree though, a more in-depth look would be better.
ZDnet?  unix?  rofl.
I didn't say they do all those things. I said they use the same method to divert the public eye from the problems in their own countries even if those problems are totally different.

I don't think our western leaders are as moral as you think they are. Most of them are orders of magnitudes better than people allowing the things you mentioned but they are far from the ideal moral leaders and as long as people don't see that the "true leaders with real moral standards" you mention won't be elected since people won't see a difference between our current major party candidates and the ones from smaller parties that still have some ideals left.
Handwriting will never die because people will never stop needing quickly drawn up shopping lists.

I read about the Security Council presidency on the blogs over a week ago.

Surely they retracted it.  A mile of falling cable sounds pretty dangerous.
Digikam (www.digikam.org) is a great photo management app for kde.
And you just prove my point by attacking an argument that neither I nor anyone else made supporting "our leaders" rather than addressing the point of the message.
And I thought I had an original suggestion! So, how to convince the reddit folks that they should fix this? I'd be happy to charge a large GUI consulting fee so everyone could feel better that the advice is important and needs to be implemented. :-)
I got my Tivo over 3 years ago, and we absolutely love it!  My 3 year old can run it by himself (with parental controls of course), and my wife and I record all of our favorite shows on it.  As soon as the kids go to bed, its TiVo time!
Why is it that whenever anyone in the west criticizes their own government, that person is labelled as self-hating and accused of making excuses for foreign extremism?
I think the point is, is that there isn't a balanced view of the issue. Not taking a balanced look at what may be the root causes of Islamic extremism will solve no problems. Making pretty speeches about evil-doers and barbarians burning embassies may win public support, but it encourages no lasting, constructive solutions to the problem.
So there's this image of the insane, evil Islamic enemy created by Western leaders and perpetuated by irresponsible media coverage, either for "uniting" the country or for ratings, that contributes to this unbalanced view of Islamic extremists.
In no way am I condoning or supporting the actions of terrorrists or whackjob fundamentalists. I find their methods brutal, abhorrent, and it makes me sick the way they brainwash their own people into blowing themselves up or hating non-Muslims. But I think that to ultimately defeat them, we need to understand why the average Muslim person can be driven to believe in such madness; at least beyond the point of thinking they "hate our freedom".
The gatekeeping complaint is about opinions, not totally crazy memes like PostSecret. And Huffington Post is a gimme because it has an all-star cast from the "old media".

What Z-listers are complaining about are blogs like Instapundit, Boing Boing, and Dave Winer's Most Recent Boring and Pointless Blog, all of which are popular simply because they're popular. And the A-list popularity doesn't seem to spread around very well in the gigantic blogosphere.
That is very cool!  However, I have a TiVo Series 1.  Is there anything I can do to upgrade it to enable this feature?  I would probably need to add an ethernet connection right?

Decent read but I was ambivalent to start with and the massive ads plastered all over the top clinched the vote. Just saying that you may wish to move some of those ads around a bit to deeper into the article.
A mostly unintelligent rant by Joel (err, some random guy).  I think one commentor made the best point --

"Rails would be a much better environment if the 'scaffolding' feature was removed altogether.  While it was possibly intended as a feature for rapid prototyping, too many Rails newcomers (many who appear to not have had experience with any previous frameworks) seem to think that this is how you go about building a production quality app"

Note to Joel (err, some random guy)...buy the damn rails book I know that $23(amazon) won't put a hole in your pocket!  It will make half your rants fall away.
no, that's clueless. There's massive incentive to hype peakoil, starting with the incentive for any two-bit idiot to jump on the next big bandwagon, to alternative energy companies, to the media, which benefits from a hype, any hype.

Furthermore, the comparison, from me or the article, is simply this:

just because a large load of experts all say that X is going to happen and it's going to suck big time, doesn't mean that you should take it as a given that X is really going down. That's the full extent of the comparison.

Ramming your peak oil crud down by calling dissenters dumb and/or idiots is as dumb as it gets :-P
You know what?  Political argument aside, this article sucks!  I can't believe the AP allowed this feed.  There are two spelling mistakes and three grammer errors, aside from a pitifully slanted tone.  Boo hiss.
I mostly agree with you.  Only dissagreement is that I don't think that was Joel ranting, just someone participating in the discussions on his site.

But yeah, for now, you need to get the book.  It's really not that long.... the first 200 pages or so are for a very good walkthrough, the rest I've only used as a reference so far.
Oh my bad, you are right it was not Joel.  But at least the rant spurred some discussion.
I guess they want the recommendation algorithm to be fine tuned better before they do that..... Maybe.
This is like that Danny DeVito movie where a company continuously gains market share of a continuously decreasing  market, until they have 100% of a market that sells nothing. The executives are trying to stuff the genie back into the bottle, and they are committing professional suicide.
Kind of wierd. Makes me wonder, who would think up something like this? But after watching the whole thing, I have to say that it is absolutely awesome....it made me feel like I could SEE the music. Very, very cool.
This is a very nice tool! You can get a free trial to test it out, or if it is an OSS project you can get a free license.

But if you are using SVN, just using [Trac](http://www.edgewall.com/trac/) might be fine for repository browsing.
You might try Teach Yourself Better Handwriting.  I got the book, but I'm too lazy to actually use it, so I can't say whether it would really help, but the exercises they recommend make a lot of sense to me.

They had a chimp climb the rope with a pin to pop them. Heard it on "Monkey News".
hehehe... all the fans are really hammering the forum now.
How did 7 people mod this to the front page WHILE it was on the front page?
Okay, let me start out this comment by saying that Rails annoys me in a lot of ways as well. I use Rails for my dayjob and while I enjoy it (and the productivity increases are a massive step over PHP), in a lot of ways it is unecessarily complex - and like the poster stated, a lot of that comes with the "Rails rules" that no on mentions until you use it. It just does a lot of quirky things that you don't necessarily expect, and a lot of that comes from DHH's "opinionated software approach", which quite frankly gets in the way a lot of the time when you don't want to follow the "opinionated software approach" that DHH has prescribed for Rails and anyone who uses it. Yes, you can customize just about everything in Rails, but that takes time...why should I be taking the time to redo something in Rails that I don't like when I could've probably written it from the ground up faster and more efficiently? Its things like that which actually cut back against what Ruby is in a lot of ways ("there is more than one way to do it"), and are actually detrimental to what Rails is trying to do (fast efficient development).

But the first thing anyone needs to realize before they use Rails is this: you are not using your framework. You are using Dave HH's framework that he is letting you use. I cannot state how many times he has said something along the lines of "we do so-and-so in Rails because that's how I think it should be." He's a very opinionated individual and he rarely backs down - so if you disagree with a lot of his ideas, stay away from Rails or you'll find yourself fighting against them a lot.

However, some of the things that this guy is ranting about are STUPID.

&gt; "But do you remember that moment in the demo when the play turns ugly with a big ole error page? It's when he tried to update his db schema or model or something. It doesn't work because he has to reboot the webserver before those changes take effect. Which he says and moves on quickly. Well, it turns out that webserver rebooting requirement really sucks when you're trying to, um, Rapidly Application Develop."

Let's put it this way: *big freaking deal*. Restarting the webserver (and this is only something you do very rarely) takes maybe 5 seconds to do. Whoop-tee-doo.

I'll be the first to say that Rails ain't perfect. It frustrates me a lot. But if you are going to offer some criticism, at least make it constructive.
Yes, I think this is the first time I've ever seen a "dupe" on Reddit.

Don't turn into the dupefest that is Digg and Slashdot! I fear that perhaps Reddit is outgrowing the small site it used to be.
That's why I said they should check if it's been submitted sans-question mark. For those cases where a question marked URL has already been submitted, there's no fix. Well, besides the one everyone on this comments page likes.

What were the grammar errors?

There are lots of dupes. Many triples, in fact. The ones that get onto the front page are (usually) the ones whose predecessors were around when the site had many fewer visitors, and who therefore don't remember the previous incarnations. This one is weird, though. I don't know why this is happening.
I like Rails a lot (and wish I could use it at my day job), but having to restart the web server because you changed a bit of HTML is annoying:

http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/54290#new

In any case, yeah, it has a few warts, but I think it's head and shoulders above most of the other stuff out there, and I've helped build some of that other stuff.
Yeah. Exactly. If the up arrow isn't good enough, just make a damn comment.
Mysql is a real 'worse is better play'.  With 5.0, it's basically got most of the features of a real database, although afaict, the default is still those shitty MyISAM tables.

It's unbelievable how many Mysql sites without even transactions are out there, happily munging people's money...
It can be a real headache planning a holiday to a destination you know absolutely nothing about...

I mostly agree, however, one should take unconscious work into account. Reading Poincaré or Hadamard*, on how they found great theorems, is enlightning. Therefore, doing "other" things, but not any, and letting your mind work by itself is a strong strategy, if you manage to do it. If you manage, because another aspect of how terrifying are big problems, is that you may not be able to stop facing them.
It is important to take these points into consideration, because it makes all the more difficult to know whether you are doing bad procrastination, or finding a way to get into a state of consciousness (or unconsciousness) were your mind operates efficiently. All the more even, as very often you do not find what you where looking for, but something else. Which is likely to happen, because you don not know the landscape before you are really watching it form inside.

Who claimed there was "moral equivalence" here? Clearly no western leader condones honour killings or any equivalent.

All he said was that the "hate them, not us" trick is being used by the American government as well. Notice that the administration is now talking about "another 10 years of war", and drawing analogies to the Cold War.
They kept up the Cold War until Russia said "we don't want to play any more". I wonder if the Islamic world will reach the same point one day... and whether America will stop if they do.

So if I mark this down, does that mean reddit things I don't like it? Cause I do like the story, just not the dupe. Maybe we need a "dupe" button inbetween the arrows - to try and get dupes off the front page as fast as possible.

That's the kicker... MySQL's only structural problems anymore are that it has more gotchas, but indeed 5's default, myISAM, still has *no* referential integrity *or* transactions.

You know, the thing central to the relational model and the thing that allows you to handle more than one connection at once without screwing your data up.

Their attitude of 'speed over correctness' turned me off years ago. I don't mind being able to turn them off for when you don't really need them - with warning messages saying 'this is an advanced option for users that really know what they are doing'. Not as the *default* to the masses that just bought a "PHP+MySQL yay!" book.


It's funny that MySQLs claims of speed seem to only really apply to INSERTs and UPDATEs and very minimally on the SELECTs, the bulk of the queries in any dynamic content system. And, of course, that alterations become as fast as on postgres when you do enable the things that make it, you know, adhere to correctness and stardards. Surprise surprise, y'know...:)
How about http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html vs. http://sql-info.de/postgresql/postgres-gotchas.html ?

It's old, though. A number of things is probably not true anymore. It's not that long ago, though, and still fairly revealing of their attitude towards correctness.

(Me, I like guarantees, since that's half the reason I use a database in the first place. And I like features. Given the business choice I'd probably use MS SQL, despite that I have no MS love)

I prefer SQLite.  Easier to use yet still powerful.
I wonder what conditions are like for the coalition soldiers who have been captured?  Has anyone seen an article about what it's like in an insurgent, Al Qaeda, or Taliban POW camp?
Not many get captured is the truth.  Those that do get videotaped and a ransom requested.  Often they get decapitated.  Most that are captured by insurgents are in fact civilians.  The coalition soldiers know better than to be located where they have a chance of being captured.  Sniped at sure, suicide bombed, yes, but not captured.

You call tha disturbing?  Maybe you should see what gets put up on some of the Iraqi sites some of which makes it onto ogrish.com
But it doesn't scale with concurrent access. For smaller projects it is an easy and cool option, though.

There isn't much music out there that isn't RIAA. It's just hard to exist that way as a company, and RIAA tends to be the least bother for many artists. They handle the PR and whatnot (...usually, if it suits them. The case of the long-unreleased Fiona Apple album because 'they didn't know how to market it' comes to mind.) 

Thing is, once an artist signs, the music company inherently has a medium term monopoly on the artist. If you go by taste, you basically have no choice in RIAA/nonRIAA whatsoever. That part's not a free market.
You're absolutely right, I was actually making a snarky comment about how the prisoners at Abu Ghraib are treated far better than captured civilians or coalition forces.  Can anyone imagine a captured westerner being given a Bible, a lawyer, and due process by those people?
What is this doing with 7 points on reddit? Terrifying.

I feel like most of his points are unwarranted and could have been resolved had the author done more research.

The users of Reddit love 'heroes' and 'fallen angels'. 

I admit it is kind of refreshing to hear some criticisms of the much-hyped Ruby on Rails.

that is such a fucking lie. are you an RIAA stooge?

comment back with more non-RIAA labels. and fuck people who think all music is RIAA approved.
&gt;It makes me so sad that our governments continually turn a blind eye to any of the root causes of terrorism, focussing only on ridiculous notions of them "hating our freedom".

That's only lip service to cater to the unwashed masses. The reasons for destabilising the area run deep and are explored in [The Clash of Civilisations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_civilizations).  It's a good read even if you don't agree with Huntington's thesis.
Its too bad that stories about petrodollar and the IOB allways gets modded down here on Reddit. Can someone who press the downarrow please explain why?
&gt;There are VERY few true leaders in power around the Western world. A good deal of the reason for this is because of attitudes like yours that are self-hating and make excuses for intolerable acts by repeating the kindergarten mantra of "he did something bad too" to deflect blame and support a stupid and pointless political argument.

I agree that there aren't many leaders, but I think the reason is more to do with the fact that we have the presence of mind to not need being lead. We can choose our own path. The core belief of Locke's original Liberalism was that we are not ruled by government -we delegate responsibilities to government.
So it seems the RIAA wants to limit people's ability to listen to legal CD's. Wait a minute...

Yet another reason not to buy CD's.

As I understand it, browser memory leaks come largely from the fact that JS and the DOM are separately garbage collected, objects can be referenced between the two (of course), which really tests the GCs' rules of cooperation, imperfect in at least FF and IE.

In fact, when reference counting is used, you can defeat the GC in a few lines of javascript, and with the crossover it's even easier. Possible fun reference constructs like closures help avoid it, though I think they can also cause it.

I believe is the problem in IE is fairly unsolvable as it necessarily has a crossover between the application and ActiveX/COM (reference counting). 

Yeah, firefox has a hope of fixing this since it handles both parts. Sounds like complex stuff, though.
I think in most cases "doesn't scale with concurrent access" is a myth.  There's no magic in other DBMSs that make *true* concurrent access possible.  Each one can only simulate concurrent access.  Feel free to reply with counter examples.
What, now even vague association, in fact the word 'Joel' alone, will bring disapproval? The hell? What are we reddit users, *thirteen*?

Hmm... Interested. Which book is that? It's sort of useful to know that beforehand, you know, which you generally don't:)

'having to restart the web server because you changed a bit of HTML is annoying'

You don't. I don't know what issue the poster in that link was having, but it is not rails' normal behaviour. In development mode, rails reloads all your application code on each request. You should only need to restart the web server if you change the database connection configuration. 

The templates also run live in production mode, so you can change them without a restart there too should you want to.
As a half-arab/half-WASP zionism-hater, I can say the following: not everyone is a jew, dammit!

This trend of "jewifying" key people in power is SO old and tired. What's next? Desmond Tutu is also a jew? Pinochet is a jew (Allende too)! Franco was a jew! And so are Queen Sofía and Queen Elizabeth. Neils Bohr is a jew! And Robert Fripp too. And let's not even mention Yasser Arafat's true roots...

This is garbage. Or is it a not-so-clever troll?
Yes, this is one of the things that bugs me about reddit at the moment. We need a spam button and a dupe button for each story, as well as the usual up and down arrows.

I can find two: a missing comma in p6 and an extra one in p12.  The rest of the "errors" are probably acceptable since the article uses a conversational tone.

Article on authenticating users over the telephone.
I first started using Rails in November, and while the famous "fall from scaffolding" -- the need to actually *learn* Ruby and the hidden, magic rules of Rails -- can be abrupt, I have never been so productive in my 16 yrs of development.

Rails strongest feature is its awesome developer community. The mailing lists, the IRC room -- everyone makes it their business to help each other out.
Not much there, but it has potential.

"Denmark is about to assume the presidency of the UN Security Council"

I've heard this before but didn't see why it's significant. Does any nation really have much power in the UN besides the veto nations? 

I know this is simplistic, but I just have a vision of the "president nation" taking roll call and taking care of administrative duties while the veto nations sit in the corner and negotiate the important issues...

*reads* 

Hmm, indeed, it seems I judged too quickly.

I just figured that since DBs tend to bottleneck applications to IO, the read/write transaction combination cases that are allowed, vs. transactions likely being openings of locked files, would make it just wait longer and be sort of fatal-as-in-yawning when trying to standing up to hundreds of accesses per second, like big systems may easily need to. Apparently not a common perforance test case somehow...

They do note a writer starvation problem, but also that they improved it with a locking/journaling thing. And they do note that they do have a read/write concurrency system through POSIX locks so that shared reading is pretty smart, which is really the type most necessary.

It actually looks a bunch cooler than I thought, being ACID and all...
&gt;They're not being irrational, they just value the enjoyment of being part of this experiment more than the difference in their valuations of the objects they're trading.

You're describing irrationality.

&gt;You could argue that they're acting on incomplete information. If someone decides that participating wasn't worth it after all, their negative experience will become part of their "information" so they don't make the same mistake again. All in all, this is a really interesting economics experiment.

Again, you are describing an irrational agent and trying to explain it by assymetric information.
If you have to restart the web server to see changes to HTML

* You aren't in development mode
* You modified config/environments/development.rb to cache, or
* Your browser is caching

Like nicholaspd said, the normal behavior in development mode is to display changes immediately.
damn I have to toss my tape deck now.

first time I agree with fnord
Since he was talking so much about databases, I bet he was complaining about having to restart the webserver whenever he messed with the database, which, if he was dealing a lot with databases, would be reasonably annoying.
The mixed system was successful for your aunt. Comparing anecdote to anecdote, the person in the linked article died because of private health care beaurocracy. Hence, I suggested this was a demonstration of success in the NHS. I mean, do you even read your own posts?

If you want to move away from anecdotes and use statistics and so on, then feel free.
Also should be mentioned is the buttload of money you're supposed to pay for using MySQL for closed-source commercial purposes.  

From their Licensing Policy: 

&gt; If you distribute a proprietary application in any way, and you are not licensing and distributing your source code under GPL, you need to purchase a commercial license of MySQL

This implies that if you have a company that makes a closed source product AT ALL, even if it's completely unrelated to 
the database you have to buy a commerical license.

(vs. BSD licensed PostgresSQL - completely free)
OH MY GOD!  *Now* I know how to do it!
Broken link.
if, by "..don't want to play any more", you mean, the government collapsed; then, yes, I agree
It seems that the story was from a [blog](http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?bid=1&amp;pid=60212) published by The Nation. Yahoo did put the word "opinion" at the top of the story, though rather indistinctly. They ought to have made that clearer.

but at digg one can browse stories by category (another type of filter)- which means that a simple click will take me to what i want to read.  is the value added using your filtering approach significant enough (assuming the filter works)?


Part 2 of a detailed write-up on how to implement a cool auto-hiding, transparent dock with JS and CSS. This part describes how the actual animation works.
Err... you are mixing up cause and effect here. *First*, Gorbatchow got sick and tired of the Cold War, and *then* -- actually, *years* later -- the government collapsed. Not the other way round.

And actually, the government didn't collapse, either. Cause, you know, there's a significant difference between a collapse and a putsch.
brilliant.  all americans should read this, and think (a novel idea, i know).
although the spelling is atrocious.
&gt; You don't understand. Our leaders are doing the same, they just don't go to the extremes. They need a common enemy too, to divert the public eye from their own failures inside their own countries.

A lot of small-government conservatives are implicitly making the same point right now when they complain about GOP legislators using pork projects to lodge themselves more permanently in office.  The elephant in the room, of course, is that the GOP couldn't get away with these shenanigans if the Dems were stronger on foreign policy.

So what you really seem to be saying here is that the party in power gets to set the agenda.  That's not even subject to debate; it's a basic truth of politics everywhere.

I think people are reacting to this post because it's written carelessly.  The parallels you're drawing are certainly there, but starting off your statement with "You don't understand. Our leaders are [like Thuggish Dictators]..." is either inflammatory or careless.

And of course, talking about "ideal moral leaders" from the minor parties doesn't buy you a lot of credibility.
We miss the end of the article, here it is:

21. When I "interrogate prisonners", they'll just tell me crap, so that instead of discovering parts of the map, it will add some more hazy, brown "Fog of Bullshit" layer.

22. Oh no, no brown fog after all: what's nice with bullshit is that you can't tell it apart from truth until you've tasted it. That way, I'm sure never to figure out that interrogation by torture is counter-productive.

23. I want public opinion to figure outPoW vs. regular criminals vs. innocent people merely suspected of shoplifting ratio in my PoW centers. And I want them to go mad when they realize that I don't care of these fucking figures.

24. In a realistic sim, "bringing democracy and freedom" will be undoable by means of torture and puppet politicians.

25. In a real sim, i want "factions, [...] News Media, Private Corporations, asshole allies and friendly enemies" to be buyable, and to be able to buy me (and my reelection campaign). And I want to be able to buy them a "Nude Zero-Gravity Futureball championship overtime" when I need one.

26. About mission objectives: I want to set them all by myself during my election campaign. I want a "Patriotic self-censorship" button to tune down whoever questions the logics of my goalsettings (that would look like a portrait of Sen. McCarthy).

27. I want my firing everyone from CIA board increase the mess done by "CIA Field Agents that operate completely on their own agenda".

28. I want the game to start BEFORE the war, so that I can ask myself a couple of questions: is this war worth being fought? Among the wars that ought to be fought, is this one the most urgent one? If I fail to identify the most urgent threats, I want my army to be stuck in my unwinnable war, and powerless to fight my real foes, and watch Dr. Strangelove building nukes because he knows that: 1) I've shown that I don't attack those who have nukes and 2) he KNOWS I'm powerless for some time.

So that makes our behavior right?  Nice logic there, keylime.
...you call me a RIAA stooge even while I insinuate they have and abuse too much power? Hm. People who voted me down, please elaborate on why. I'm wondering about your opinions since I'm trying to adjust mine for reality. 


What's a lie? Okay, the 'hard to exist' thing is perhaps a little overstated; I was just thinking of the fact that RIAA controls a big bunch of the easier marketing methods, while indie labels apply more to people's taste using artists' talent. That's not knocking either at all, it's where I think a fair bunch of cool stuff is too. I'm just saying that that can be a harder process in the end from the label's POV and for the artist who has to get known to be able to tour to make enough money to be a musician - though of course it works out in the end. 

I imagine a fair number of musicians just go with RIAA-based companies because - well, why not? It may be easier for them, it works, and they don't necessarily see a huge direct difference, other than in the screwy politics RIAA plays.


And yes, I know not all music is RIAA approved. My point is this list: 

http://www.riaa.com/about/members/

Some mighty big names in there. So I just wandered over to my CDs and took a very rough (Was going by http://www.magnetbox.com/riaa/search.asp ) partial index. Despite that I have pretty damn unmainstream taste 63 are RIAA-based, 33 not.

That's the low-choiceness I meant. I wasn't saying there are no indie labels, or there's no good music in them (it'd be rather silly to say that).

It's the fact that *if I go by my music taste*, I have no control whatsoever over whether the artist is signed to a RIAA company or not (There's more Sony, WB and less clear likes out there than I like), and if it's coolness rather than politics I buy by, I have no control over supporting a RIAA company or not.


Give me a workable alternative to that fact. I'll take it in a second.
Has anyone noticed that this article is over 6 years old?

There are a few ways to define a hierarchy of classes in an object system. One is through "extension", i.e. some way of defining that class A extends class B. Java, Python, etc, etc. Javascript and IO (among others) use prototyping. Instead of saying explicitly "class A extends class B" you say "A is a clone of B" and then say "by the way, A has this function foo also". You don't have a big "class definition" you just "prototype" what A is by declaration.

B.hello = function()...

A = B.clone()

A.foo = function()...

A.bar = function()...

MyA = A()

MyA.foo() (calls A's foo implementation)

MyA.bar() (calls A's bar implementation)

MyA.hello() (calls B's hello implementation)

That said, a read through the nice Yahoo Javascript UI library source code is a very nice example of some high quality Javascript.

Yes, the community is amazing. Actually I think that community stems from the awesome Ruby community more than anything. I have an example, though not specific to Rails.

About a week ago I picked up a book called *Learn to Program* by Chris Pine at my local bookstore. It more or less was the basics of programming with some other stuff thrown in, and it used Ruby for its examples. It was a very short and concise book and was enjoyable to read.

When I got done a few days ago, the author had left his e-mail address at the end of the book and offered for anyone to contact him.

I wrote out an e-mail to him about my thoughts on the book, Ruby, and programming in general. The very next day I got a 1 page e-mail back from him.

It was very cool to see someone take that much time just to respond to a single person who had read their book. I think this example is a good snapshot of what must of the Ruby (and Rails) community is like.

The last Rails app I built I absolutely would not have been able to finish if it were not from a lot of help from many individuals in the Rails IRC room.

I don't know too many other frameworks or programming languages that have such an active and helpful community. I go to the Rails chat, ask a question, and I'll get an immediate response. I ask a question in the CSS or C# chat on the same server, and I'll usually get something along the lines of someone linking me something and telling me to read it.

A lot of the Rails people will actually take their time to sit down and listen to your problem and help you. Its extremely refereshing, that's for sure.

Oh, and Mike, in response to your mention on scaffolding - yeah, I wish it didn't even exist in Rails because not only do I not even use it, but its extremely misleading as to what Rails actually is. People see a video of scaffolding and think "him, looks like I can make very limited apps very quickly". Rails realistically though is an extremely robust framework (I might even say somewhat bloated). I guess maybe Rails needs scaffolding as part of its marketing, but its certainly one of the things I enjoy least.
"There isn't much music out there that isn't RIAA."

there is a lot of music out there that is not RIAA. that is why you got voted down.

maybe your taste isn't so 'unmainstream'

everything i listen to is cool, and a very small minority of it is on RIAA labels.

of course, if you like what you hear on the radio, because you don't actually have any taste, then, yeah, you're gonna like RIAA crap more often than not.

Glenn Doman has been actually doing this and selling books about it for years.  I don't want to look like his shill, so look him up yourself.  :)
Don't like the RIAA attempting to steal your fair-use rights?  Join the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/).

Recently I was surprised to learn that the EFF has only 9,000 members.  Given how many computer-savvy folks have their free-speech and fair-use rights threatened every day by big, weaselly companies, I would think that 9,000 is but the tiniest subset of the people who *ought* to be EFF members.  Are you are one of those people?

If you are not an EFF member, please think about whether you ought to be.

The author rants a bit toward the end, but overall an informative blog entry.

Hilarious!
You know, I see your point.  I guess our disagreement is probably because I don't believe in irrational behavior, because there is no absolute standard of rationality.  If you simply say that people are acting irrationally according to a particular model, then maybe it's time to fix the model.  Everything is rational if you change your point of view to match the other person.

Even getting piss drunk is rational to many people, because of their time preference for pleasure.

I'm pretty sure based on your comments that you would not participate in such an experiment.  Neither would I.  But beware of assuming that you are more rational than other people just because they act in a manner that doesn't make sense to you.  Perhaps they would act differently if they knew better, but that IS really just assymetric information at work.

Weave Words is a fun computer word game where you play to uncover well known phrases and sayings. The game presents you with a hexagonal grid of letter tiles, which must be used to create words of three or more letters. Once a word is made, you are awarded points based on its length and content (like Scrabble). Letters from the word can then be chosen to try to uncover parts of the hidden popular phrase or saying.

Collusion in online poker might be harder to pull off than you  think.  The sites know who you play with, and every hand you play, and how you play it.  They automatically flag any suspicious teaming up or strange play of hands.  I have friends who've had their accounts frozen for a couple days while the site investigated possible collusion.

And even if there's rampant cheating, the absolutely terrible play is even more rampant.  It is a fact that it is incredibly easy to make a good deal of money at online poker  by simply playing well.  If a few people are cheating you, its hard to tell since there are a thousand others that are essentially donating you their money.

I was in the same boat until a few months ago, which is when I found the following web site (via Reddit) on italic handwriting: 

http://briem.ismennt.is/4/4.1.1a/4.1.1.1.quick.htm

I've long thought that renaissance texts had a beautiful look to them and was immediately hooked. I now actually receive compliments on my handwriting, something I never considered possible. I recently picked up a fountain pen (Parker Sonnet) with a narrow italic nib. It gives much more satisfying results than a regular pen and has proven hassle-free so far.

Reminds me of a Star Trek episode where the alien character "Q" appeared dressed as a soldier from our future.  The combat uniform included a small pouch on the chest full of cocaine or something like cocaine.  A straw was attached for easy snorting.  I found the concept chilling as fiction and even more so now as it approaches reality.
No. Rational behaviour in relation to economics is well defined to mean an agent that is optimizing their profits by paying for as little as they can and by selling for as much as they can. 

You correctly pointed out that some of the irrationality *could* be explained by externalities (like thinking you can profit in the future from the fame gained by dealing with the red-paper-clip-person) but 'having fun' is not an externality.

I'm not saying I wouldn't participate in such an experiment, I'm just pointing out that it's not an example of relative value. I agree with you that relative values are interesting, but the people aren't trading with this guy because they really need a red paper clip and all they can spare is a fish shaped pen. They are doing it for fun.

Rock on Saudi Arabia.
The null hypothesis Southerton specifies is incorrect. The Book of Mormon claims that several small groups of people (one or two families) emigrated to the New World from the Sinai Penninsula. If this were true, then the small genetic pool from which the later populations sprang would most likely be very different from that of the middle eastern population as a whole. If genetic markers were overwhelmingly Middle Eastern in origin, it would be indicative of a mass migration, not a small-scale displacement of a few families.

My guess would be that the elevator would connect to something that's in a geosynchronous orbit - that is, it doesn't really move in relation to the ground, so the anchor would just stay in one spot.
There are other good CS book reviews on the website, by the same author.

Um, this has happened before (Shroud of Turin, anyone?) and there's an established response that the Church can make: "God works in mysterious ways." Or, alternatively, "we've been interpreting the book wrong, our mistake, but not God's."

What I'm worried is that scientists will continue doing these sort of naughty religious tests. One of these days they might find an inconsistency in Islam, and then that'll be the end of it.

Creepy and fascinating at the same time.

Some good advice, but IMHO not so good as Scalzi. &lt;br&gt;
First, while I agree that the active voice should be preferred, the passive voice has its merits. It is necessary if you want to indicate a neutral viewpoint and shift your role as narrator into the background. If you *want* to "makes it seem like the whole world sits around waiting for something to happen", then it is the perfect approach. &lt;br&gt;
And no, please, *please* don't invite people to use "propped-up" metaphoric language. These kind of language is
an inexhaustible source of unintended humor...like "The linebacker stripped the running back off the ground." &lt;br&gt;
And third, he criticizes Scalzi because Scalzi didn't use the rules of sentences, but he freely admits that he himself isn't able to come up with a good definition of a sentence.
My mother language has actually more than 260 (!) rules of grammar and no, I never indulged to learn them by heart, I learned to use them by reading. In fact, many writers don't care to learn them.
First,

   Genetic markers are usually compared to a population via frequency, i.e. a given set of markers will have a particular distribution for a given population. However a small draw from that population will most likely not be very representative. Hence the distribution of markers in a population that arose from a small sample of the large distibution will not closely mimic that of the large population from which it was drawn.

Second, if large scale massive migration occured from Northern Asia, the more massive and the later that migration occured the more likely the population would have a similar distribution of markers to that of the parent population that we see in Northern Asia today. What the current genetic research indicates is that there was migration from northern asia; this does not preclude small group migration from the middle east, or anywhere else, previous to the asian migration.

http://www.ewg.org/issues/pfcs/20041216/tsca_letter.pdf - Some report talking about various studies about how teflon raise cholesterol

http://www.ewg.org/reports/toxicteflon/es.php - A fun quote from this one:
&gt;DuPont studies show that the Teflon offgases toxic particulates at 446°F. At 680°F Teflon pans release at least six toxic gases, including two carcinogens, two global pollutants, and MFA, a chemical lethal to humans at low doses. At temperatures that DuPont scientists claim are reached on stovetop drip pans (1000°F), non-stick coatings break down to a chemical warfare agent known as PFIB, and a chemical analog of the WWII nerve gas phosgene.

More stuff can be found here: http://www.ewg.org/issues/siteindex/issues.php?issueid=5014
You know, I've heard of this stuff that in all of our food that is made up of two things that are completely toxic and will kill you.

* The first one is a metal that will actually burn with dropped into water.  Imagine eating this.

* The other component was a poison gas used by the Germans in World War I.

Anyone care to guess the substance?
I am not really a comic kind of person, but I am interested in the potential here. Perhaps it was the art from different artists that was added to the book, or just a desire to get more for the story.
I think that non-governmental metal backed currencies will fail because they solve only the inflation problem.  Economies have many other needs that are not met by metal backed currencies.  For example, currency exchange provides important indicators of economic health.  A country sharing currency with another is more vulnerable to the other's economic troubles than a country with its own currency.  So far the only countries that decide to share currency also share significant regulatory infrastructure.  For example: the EU, dominant countries and their colonies, the USA.  Anarchists who oppose such regulation would support metal backed currency.  But the reality is that the world is not anarchist and governments need to manage their nations.  Modern currencies facilitate their management.

History has shown that countries move to modern floating currencies and prosper.  After WWI, Japan followed other countries in leaving the gold standard.  Then in January of 1930 they decided to return to it, fixing the price of the yen to a specific amount of gold.  Even with the onset of the Great Depression, the government went ahead.  It was compared to "opening shutters in the middle of a typhoon."  Exports were stifled and the economy floundered.  The government pretended that everything would be ok and that, through the failure of non-competetive firms, the economy would benefit in the long term.  Two years later, in Dec 1931, Japan left the gold standard.  The value of the yen was allowed to float.  It immediately dropped by 40%.  The government invested in industry by issuing bonds.  (What some call "debt" I call "investment".)  Through the application of Keynesian economic policies, Japan was one of the first nations to recover from the Great Depression.

That's funny, but I think it's an overstatement.  The article advises scubbing cast iron with sea salt and rinsing.  In order to season cast iron, you're supposed to brush olive oil on the surface and bake it in the oven.  Or, you can just keep using it.  

For best results, avoid scrubbing with soap and harsh abrasives.
I wouldn't want to get anodized aluminum really hot...the kind of high heat cast iron handles well.

Dunno about that.  The rise of fundamentalism -- both Islamic and Christian -- seems *very* relevant to me in 2006.
The nazis considered Jews as genetically inferior people longing for world domination and tried to build the image that they are infesting the worlds like rats.
They tried to exterminate them by genocide.
But even at their best time they were *still* a minority.
After the allies defeated Germany, they were surprised that there were actually quite normal people there and that many
Germans desperately tried to withstand the nazis.
Ok, suddenly they realized that Stalin isn't a nice guy anymore and they needed Germany. *Now* it was clear that the Soviet Union was a collection of brainwashed people who are
continually sending spies to subvert the USA. While the Communist Party in the USA had continually (until now) an *evanescent percentage* of members in relation to the population, it was necessary to install a HUAC operating outside the law to save the population. 
Ok, now after the Cold War, Glasnost &amp; Perestroika we realized that the Soviets weren't so bad after all. We can talk with them. Oh, and several millions of them died in Gulags because they resisted Stalin &amp; Co.

However, it *does* mean that efforts at conversion that hinge on the (alleged) Middle Eastern bloodlines are bogus.

And let's face it, the (possible) ambiguity of this is just one genetic result (which, if nothing else, is at least *some* kind of evidence on the issue).  In the grander scheme, the mormon mythology make a number of claims that are (generously) difficult to accept at face value.
I'm hoping that this is a sort of meta-joke by the creator of the petition.  Otherwise, the degree of idiocy involved in its creation is unfathomable.

How so?  Is it not true that all American companies are hurt by the fact that part of their profits must be spent on health care for their workers, and this is only made worse for car companies because they are competing with foreign companies that can bring their unit costs down because they don't have this expense.  Much like any American company must deal with if they are competing with a foreign company?

At first I was shocked...could *I* actually be agreeing with George Will?  But then I got to the end, where he says that Congress should just make wiretapping legal, and I realized that, no, I did not.  This article makes no mention of the issue of the large scale and randomness of the wiretapping.  Legalizing that would be a serious affront to personal liberty.  On that note, does anyone know if the NSA has continued to wiretap at the same level that it did before the program was exposed?

I have my doubts concerning Nonie Darwish and her writings.
First of all, the rightly mentioned that Fedayeen did terrorist attacks, but failed to mention that the mass of Palestinensian refugees gave Egypt itself a hard time.
Second, she claims that Nasser mentioned her father (or the
retaliation of his death) during the speech announcing the nationalisation of the Suez Canal.

Now unfortunately this speech is available in the web
http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1956Nasser-suez1.html

Correct me, but there is no mentioning of her father or
retaliation of his death.

Next thing where I felt uneasy: She claimed that she visited
a school in Gaza. She mentioned that millions of Muslims are educated in hate, violence and retaliation until now. Fine, but why did *she* came out unimpressed in this hostile environment ? And if Islam is barbaric, hostile etc. pp., why should she feel ashamed about her religion ?

I did a search and found her site:
http://www.noniedarwish.com/pages/745434/index.htm

And according to Wikipedia:
Nonie Darwish is a freelance writer for the online journal, FrontPageMag.com, edited by David Horowitz.

I just came back to post what you said :p It's a shame though really, he raises some valid points, but he covers them up well with ad-hominem attacks. Then again, on more then a few occasions I wondered if the author even understood most points of the original rant, stuff like:

It might be a shock to him that the original point was that you had to _buy_ a book to get some kind of manual, saying that you can buy the manuals from Amazon does more to confirm the original point then it does to refute it.

I like the idea of distributing video content through putting it on your iPod at the local Blockbuster's. Certainly solves the problem of day-long downloads for decent-quality movies.

Since Apple controls the iPod's internals, there shouldn't be any DRM problems.

Looks like someone has been eating too many retard sandwiches.
I didn't expect this to last on the front page all night.  I've been familiar with this type of DNA testing for a few years, and I've sensed no change in the doctrine.  Surely anyone who cares about mormonism has heard this before, so I don't see how it qualifies as "new on the net."

Anyway, the reaction inside the church is usually a mix of danteembermage's "one or two families isn't a large enough pool for statistical significance" and the more true-believer style of "God works in mysterious ways."  There are a few who leave the church, like the guy whose picture is on the right side of the article, but he's actually a born-again Christian now (DNA disproves the Book of Mormon, so surely the answer is that the earth is 6000 years old), or at least he appears in several anti-mormon, pro-born-again videos.

I personally don't know of anyone who is a mormon because of the scientific support; most believe because they have had personal experiences that led them to believe, and most continue believing because the lifestyle and culture makes them happy (and many stop believing if it doesn't make them happy).  One of the many reasons I like mormonism is that I think it's ballsy for Joseph Smith to have made so many falsifiable claims.  Even while he was alive people were crying foul and "disproving" the faith, and it continued to grow then, and continues to grow now.  It's either a sign that the religion has something very good, or that people are really stupid, or both.

This makes about as much sense as dismissing the report because everything is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons....

If you read the ewg.ord link above, you'll see that actual, dangerous compounds are released at higher heats. For me, the main issue is what dose occurs at which temperature.
The principle of scientific plausibility suggests that the reasonableness of any hypothesis is proportional to the ratio of data points to assumptions. In this case, the ratio is very small. The hypothesis in question is but one of many that could be produced by variation of the numerous assumptions. The selection of this specific hypothesis for publication perhaps says more about the motives of its proponents than about the subject matter.

I observe that the comments here about what Mormons believe, and why, sometimes contain a small grain of truth -- perhaps to lend plausibility to what is being said -- but are generally incorrect, or misleading in their presentation.

The focus and purpose of the Book of Mormon is not history, and it so states in numerous places. Its authors intended the book to serve as a witness of Jesus Christ as the Savior of mankind, to explain what that means, and to provide some insight into the grandest questions of human inquiry, namely, who are we, what are we doing here on this planet, and what does the future hold for us. The final author of the Book of Mormon lays down a challenge and a promise: that those who read the book with sincere intent can ascertain for themselves whether the book is true or not by studying it, pondering its message, and praying about it. On that basis, it should be considered an error for anyone to blindly take someone else's word that it is either true or false.

Another observation is that many who reject God do so by engaging in a straw man exercise -- that is, they posit the existence of a demonstrably false God, and then proceed to demonstrate that he doesn't exist. Big surprise there. (And yes, I'm aware of the potential circular logic of that statement -- but if it's true, it isn't circular.)

Finding God may be difficult, but in my experience it is worth the effort. And, surprisingly enough, it doesn't require one to abandon science, disparage the beliefs of others, or engage in wanton acts of violence. At least not if you find the real God, so be careful out there.

It isn't the "Hebrew-ness", it's the covenant relationship with God, which appears for some reason to be important in the economy of God. It seems that Abraham made such a covenant, which covenant affects his posterity in both positive--as a result of following God--and negative--for not following God--ways. Anyone not of that bloodline who enters into that same covenant is considered as if they were of that bloodline by adoption. And I suppose that those of the bloodline who reject the covenant are disowned, but that's just speculation on my part.

Suppose, hypothetically speaking, that you were Joseph Smith, and that the things that he said happened to him happened to you. How would you have responded? How do you suppose it would all have played out?

You make a very good point, but you've left out the alternative of the two possible outcomes of such an assertion.
I can hardly believe someone can be that stupid. Computers can do algebra for you? Sure, there are some symbolic calculators around, but half of algebra is thinking in the right mode and understanding variables and how to set up equations. As for computers not writing thank you notes, or reasoning, that's news to me. I often get automated thank you notes when I do some payment online, and my computer does a fairly good job of statistical reasoning when it filters my spam.

I think the article's author doesn't really know what reasoning is, though. Perhaps I can't define it well, but I know that knowing where a desert lies isn't it.

Also, it seems incredible that people could graduate from highschool without knowing algebra. Come on! In many countries you can't graduate without knowing calculus, which is in my opinion a sensible policy.

If they could find an inconsistency in Islam they would have done so already, it would make too many people happy.

Every description of seasoning that I've ever seen says to make sure you don't scrub the pan to bare cast iron.  And your description agrees with this.

Digg only uses a news promotional system, on Reddit you can demote aswell. It's just common sense that bad stories fall off  frontpage faster on Reddit.
Karl Rove wanted Bush to meet a famous person with a similar view on global warming.  He set up a meeting between the president and Michael Crichton.  So apparently you can make this stuff up, unless you think everyone Bush meets with is an expert advisor.  Personally, I think exposing the president to as many science-degree-holding Americans as possible can only help.
i suspect it's much the same as with most religions - it gives people something that makes them feel really warm and fuzzy, and although stupidity is not outright required, it certainly doesn't hurt that about half of them are of below average intelligence.

worldwide, the vast majority of religious people are religious because their parents brought them up that way. mormonism is actually unusual in that it's actively gaining adult converts; most of the major religions do not (at least not in any significant numbers), they merely raise their members' children to be new members.

(minor, brand-new religions and cults have to convert, of course, but mormonism is no longer really small enough to be counted as "minor", IMO. most major religions' missionary enterprises are feel-good undertakings with comparatively little impact on membership numbers.)

"disproving" a religion is seldom much to brag about, especially when the religion is relatively new; look how easy it is to poke holes in scientology. such disproofs never accomplish anything useful - almost no religious people believe because they feel they've seen rational, logical evidence to believe. the vast majority of them believe because they *want to*, and will flat-out ignore refutations that might otherwise cause them to stop doing this thing they want to do.

it really  doesn't matter who the native americans are descended from, or how well you prove it. if people are to this day capable of believing that life on earth has not descended from a common ancestor (or that the space dictator xenu imprisoned trillions of souls in a volcano, or whatever it was Hubbard babbled about), they'll believe *anything* that makes them feel good enough, no matter how ludicrous.
&gt; but if it's true, it isn't circular

wrong, actually. logical circularity has nothing to do with truth; circularity merely demonstrates that the argument doesn't logically demonstrate any truth. a circular argument might be stating a set of truths, if only by accident, but you'd have to use some other (non-circular) argument to show it.
Maybe **you** can't make that s**t up, but at least you could spell his name correctly.
This is a stupid article with a misleading headline on Reddit, and doesn't say that Crichton was Bush's "Global Warming Advisor"--just that Bush read one of Crichton's books.

So Bush took a meeting with Michael Crichton and that means now Crichton is advising him.  Breathtaking news analysis!

Joseph Smith?  The illiterate, ignorant farmboy who had a third-grade education?  Who wrote the book in its entirety from April to June of 1829 and then scraped the funds together to get it printed in March of 1830?  That's crazy talk; just as crazy as magical hats, seer stones and angels.  Next up: Chicago Cubs take the '06 World Series.
I think you're missing the point on this somewhat. Orwell is writing about the dangers of suppressing the truth, and tacitly supporting suppressing the truth. At the time (shortly after WW2, when Russia was a new ally), the USSR was in this role, and it had supporters (on "the left" to grossly simplify) which abetted its suppression.

The relevance today is that the current forces in power in the US ("the right" to grossly simplify) are now the ones involved in suppressing, denying, and re-writing the truth. 

Some quotes from the essay I found particularily relevant, some eerily so, 60 years later:

"A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened."

"The sort of things that are working against him [the writer attempting to report the truth] are the concentration of the press in the hands of a few rich men, the grip of monopoly on radio and the films"

"Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth."

Mr. Orwell seems a pretty clever guy. (Although I found his ramblings on poetry in the essay a bit odd)

Maybe the problem is not with the curriculum but with the teachers. I think the biggest problem with science teaching is that it mostly is done by people who just teach from a text book avoiding any passion for explaining things.

One thing you never hear in these stories is that there are plenty of natural toxins we are exposed to daily.  Our bodies actually have mechanisms for ridding themselves of poisons.  When I hear these types of stories, my first thought is of the writer's motives.  My wife gets emails all the time from her friends warning her of the dangers of Splenda, public phones, etc.  The problem is that 99% of this stuff is pure crap and the other 1% is a lot less serious than the story indicates.  I think most people just want something to blame when they don't feel good.  Your crappy life style and crummy job probably have *everything* to do with it.  Teflon isn't going to kill you.

Propaganda? I see nothing implying any sort of judgment on the person, or his race or nationality in that article. If anything, it's a puff piece in his favor.

You seem to be anticipating a negative reaction from westerners here on reddit about what he does. If that feeling is correct, it says more about the West's feelings on gov't beheadings than the author's, or even the reddit submitter's. The key tenet of propaganda is that it is clearly didactic - it doesn't try to evoke the reader's already formed sentiments on an issue, but it tries to *tell* the reader what he *should* think. I didn't see anything saying "this guy is an evil islamist that should be eliminated" in that article. Suggesting such a didactic element is present when it isn't clear is to reduce the word propaganda into meaninglessness - at that rate, anyone trying to make any sort of point whatsoever is a propagandist. Including yourself.
Sure, education might not be working too well, but from there to saying that people shouldn't learn algebra there's about a megaparsec.

I'm not sure how much I'd give credence to that "teachers are underpaid" thing. It varies a lot from country to country, but in many countries teachers are very well paid comparatively, have great holidays, and incredible job security. Also there's some tentative evidence that payment of teacher doesn't correlate with quality of education, but social prestige of teachers correlates more.

so are you saying this is a scientist/government lie?

There is a mad "Reddit Rush Hour" - posting then is guranteed to sink your post either through vote-downs or by too many posts pushing the post down. There seems to be some bot like entiry that goes around voting down posts every now and then and the reddit guys do nothing about it. Lots and lots of good stories get lost during the reddit rush hour.
Uhhhhh... yeah.  

"That's crazy talk; just as crazy as magical hats, seer stones, and angels".

You have just stated that the following two statements are equally crazy:

(1) A guy who looked in a hat that he said contained a magic rock which allowed him to see an angel and a book that he then recited to a scribe really did look in a hat that contained a magic rock which allowed him to see an angel and a book;

(2) He made it up.

Your reasoning for supporting this utterly inane equivalency boils down to "I think he was stupid".

Yeah, hello.

It's interesting the number of comments on this post.  Einstein said:

"No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."

So, before you let out your hurrahs, let's just first point ou that neither the Book of Mormon nor Mormonism dispute that there could have been other peoples in the Americas in the past.  Does this article really prove anything?  What if, in a few years, Hebrew blood is found in some American natives?  Will this then require everyone to accept Mormonism at face value?   I enjoyed the article by Michael Crichton posted here at reddit that showed the doomsdayers of 20 years ago talking about the impending global ... warming?  No! Global COOLING!

If there's anything to science, it's the word THEORY.  Not that some theories aren't better than others.  But, by the very nature of being a theory, it isn't free from dispute.  

I find the need for others to label Mormonism a "cult" or "sect" says more about their need to label it than any inherent reality.  How many cults have 10 million worldwide members and engage in the activities that Mormons do?  "By their fruits ye shall know them."

I'll tell you why the church doesn't sit around responding to every person who tries to discredit it: what would be the point?  Those who want to discredit the church won't listen, and those who believe, for the most part, can come to their own conclusions.

And, yes, I'm a Mormon.  No amount of scientific convincing will sway me either way on that (for or against).  My convictions come from other sources.
Did you read the article? He didn't violate any federal law.

On the other hand, if this was really the beginning of a fascist state, as the guy with the truck asserts, I don't think we'd ever have heard from him at all.

This is probably not up to the level of the big code generators out there, but they tend to cost money, and this one is free.  It's also entirely built on templates, so if you want to change the code it generates, just change the template.

I am using it successfully right now and it has saved me tonnes of time as a PHP developer.  Frankly I think it is awesome.  Not to mention I had to submit a progress report on my project and I was able to submit what looks like a week's worth of coding that was built in about 5 seconds, lol.

I just hope the dude who wrote it doesn't mind getting a little attention via Reddit.
It's not a law, though - it's code of federal regulations, which is basically what you are/are not allowed to do/must do as a federal employee, especially while working in your capacity as a federal employee. Check out Title 5 of the CFR, Part 734 for an exhaustive list. The CFR citation the officer lists seems pretty solid to me, but I bet there's some wiggle room in the wording.

The CFR also covers codes of dress and nonpolitical behavior, which is why those officers could have cited him for wearing a T-shirt with a scanned image of last month's Playboy centerfold, without him ever having "violated a federal law". The federal law thing is a red herring. As a federal employee, they had to have made him aware of the CFR, and he has a duty to abide by it or cease working for the US Gov't.

"Gold prices have doubled..."

[How do you figure that?](http://www.kitco.com/LFgif/au883-999.gif)
Yet another task at which java fails spectacularly.
Even if the law said he couldn't have signs on his car, it's selecitve enforcement for political purposes -- a clear violation of the 1st ammendment.

But what the regulation says is that he can't affix the signs while on government property. He didn't. He put the signs on his personal property and then drove that personal property to work.

That may seem like a tecnicality, but the regulation clearly was written with affixing signs *to* federal property in mind. He didn't do that. The political enforcers are trying to make the regulation apply where it wasn't intended, but a literal reading of the regulation thwarts that.
[deleted]
That may be a bit of an exageration. However, gold prices have gone up significantly in the past 18 months.
"A scientist is hardworking, studious, detail-oriented, observant, intelligent, exacting, and patient. When I think of a scientist, I think of someone who sets out to find the facts without predetermining what the outcome is. During this process a scientist must be fair, honest and unbiased. A scientist must be exact by following all directions and recording every step and observation, so that the experiment can be reduplicated. He/she must check and double-check all of his/her work. A scientist is very important in our lives because all of the experiments he/she does in the lab can affect our health, environment, nutrition, and other aspects of our daily and future life."

This comment (from the article's front page) was supposedly written by a seventh grader.  I'm impressed... the vocabulary and sentence structure (as well as the *ideas*) are all quite advanced for that age.  It makes me a little suspicious of whether the subjects used are typical.  For example, throw that quote into word and run a spellcheck.  Notice that the [Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch-Kincaid) estimate is 11.0 (i.e., this passage is understandable by someone with 11 grade language skills or above).  Odd.

To be fair, it could be that the class reviewed relevant terms (e.g., "exacting", "predetermined") and that the use of these in the quote drives up the score b/c it's specialized vocabulary.  Still...

Uhhhh... no.

I don't think he was stupid.  I just think he would have been unable to author the book.  For instance, you sound and write intelligently, but I don't think you could write something comparable to the Book of Mormon in three months, or over any length of time for that matter.  But, that doesn't mean you're stupid.

Critics of Joseph Smith say he's indolent, stupid, immoral, and most fundamentally, a fraud.  However, by arguing that he didn't receive divine help in translating the book, they are left trying to explain how it came about, and how it could affect millions of people around the world, even decades after his death.  I am wondering the same thing.
The article is interesting, but enough with the inflammatory headlines. Nowhere does the article say that the judge declared the US "uncivilized". This is what the article actually said:

"The judge's decision came after a day-long hearing during which he commented that America's idea of what constituted torture "is not the same as ours and doesn't appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries"."

The judge's remarks are a sharp criticism of the US treatment of inmates but stop well short of condemning an entire nation as "uncivilised".

I wonder if these scientists set out to disprove the hebrew-link.  I doubt these were lds scholars out to prove the hebrew-native american link.  Even if they were lds scholars who found no link, it would make precious little difference.  Here's why - There are four possibilities regarding this evidence.

1.  The Scientific data is true.  There's no connection.  The Book of Mormon is falsse!
2.  The Scientific data is false.  The conclusions were inaccurate.  The Book of Mormon is still safe!
3.  The Scientists twisted the data to meet their objective - to disprove the Book of Mormon, making their claim irrelevant.
4.  The data is true, but there is another explanation. i.e. There were existing natives in the americas (Nowhere does the Book of Mormon say that there weren't.)

Three out the four possibilities mean very little.  In fact, the first possibility, that there actually is no link, means very little to either the believer or the non-believer.  Both will find a way to fit this article into their existing mindset.  The author of the article probably knew this and had to throw in an lds member whose faith was "shattered."  Likely, this man was already on a path looking for something to shatter his faith so he could feel justified in embracing a new lifestyle.

Those who have received a higher witnesses from God that the Book of Mormon is true, have a witness from an infallible source.  So when men come out with scientific data, the average lds person will look at the data and think about the four possibilites I wrote about.  

On the other hand, those who love to hate mormons will grab whatever evidence supports their hatred and try to stretch it as far as it will go.  'No link?  See!  The Book of Mormon is false!'  In fact, the LA Times article was predictably slanted--the leftist anti-religion sentiment reeking pungently.

Like thaabit says, there are higher sources that can inform any sincere truth-seeker the veracity of the Book of Mormon.  Those who love to hate the mormons will never ask God in sincerity if the Book of Mormon is true simply because it doesn't fit their creed.  But if you want to find out for yourself, pick up a copy, read it, and ask God with sincerity if it is true.  It works every time.  Once he tells you it is true, articles like these will be as meaningless to you as it is to me.


Remember "The Portrait of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde? Maybe there is some truth in it.

I can't say I fully agree with this fella.  Sure I check Reddit too often in a day, but that doesn't mean I'm "wasting" my time.  By spending 10 minutes more each weekday, I am not giving up any vacation time.  Maybe your job works differently than mine, but that trade-off doesn't exist for me.
So your definition of "clear case of harassment" is notifying someone he's in violation of a statute? That's a pretty weak definition, which makes it effectively useless for purposes of conversation, unless of course you're looking to simply reinforce your own prejudices.

I've had my share of cops telling me to get off my skateboard, take my protests elsewhere, etc. but even *I* know that just as authority doesn't make you automatically right, it doesn't make you automatically wrong, either. The fight-the-power-types would have a lot more leverage if they weren't reflexively rebelling without a cause.
Since when has something like the Constitution prevented the government from enacting whatever laws it sees fit? Whether it be smoking doobs in the privacy of your own home or firing AK-47s on the privacy of your own range, the government never let anything like the Bill of Rights stop it from restricting behavior for the common good.

America is supposed to be the world's greatest democracy. More and more though, it seems like it's becoming an autocracy. Whatever happened to freedom of speech.
The regulation I read said you can't post signs or flyers "on GSA-controlled property". Whether that means "on actual GSA property" or "on any property that then appears on GSA property" is certainly up for debate. 

But that's the rub: at most it's a meddling dispute about the language of the regulation, and not some oppressive stifling of free speech. Like the whole thing with Cindy Sheehan at the State of the Union address, and how nobody made mention of the pro-Bush supporter who was asked to leave for the same reasons, this strikes me as classic bureaucratic ineptitude being twisted into some conspiratorial stifling of political dissent. It reminds me how, in my heady days of rebellious youth, I tried to turn the skateboarding ban in my town into a civil rights issue.

Another well-known individual who doesn't use email is Donald Knuth: http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html .
Please.  It's not like it's supremely well-written.  It's a good story with *literally* almost a thousand occurrances of the intellectually vapid phrase "it came to pass".

The Book of Mormon doesn't take a great writer.  It takes a creative person with a good knowledge of the Bible, which Smith clearly had.

And regardless, you're still equating the likelihood of magic with the likelihood of lying, simply because *you* think Smith incapable of writing the thing.  That's at best insipid reasoning, and at worst mere apologism.
Too true. Also the p2p networks sometimes provide unexpected 'treasure'. One can look for word documents or .xls etc. And find things people have unwittingly shared.

It brings up all sorts of questions about who is entitled to dictate the use of public space.  I certainly wouldn't support a shopowner who was doing this.  It seems pretty harmful to a community when individuals can use such invasive and undiscriminating ways of managing social space.  It seems like it's socially acceptable because of the relative powerlessness of teenagers and stereotypes about them.  If it was your kid, and you wanted to take them out shopping, would you feel any differently about a place using this thing?

Its also especially distressing to use an untested method with an upcoming deadline.

I think the biggest factor though is interest. If someone doesn't care about using the latest/greatest text editor, then they simply won't seek a better one. The time savings is not a sufficient incentive to learn more of a topic they don't care about.
Point taken, however when i read the paper on the train this morning the one think that stuck in my mind was that the judge was essentially (and i believe rightly) criticising the USA for acting in an uncivilised manner.

utter nonsense. the facts are here:
http://www.kidsource.com/kidsource/content2/perfectionist.k12.4.html#contents

The Book of Mormon actually contains 1381 instances of the phrase, or variations of it. The Bible contains 613. Curiously, there is a Mayan glyph with the same meaning. Doesn't prove anything, of course, but it makes it a plausible phrase for an ancient American document written by descendants of Hebrews.
Most people can not be categorized as strictly perfection oriented or strictly performance oriented. I think people generally make an estimation:
How important is this peace of software to *me*? I.e. do I need to use it often? Are there alternatives which I already master to a greater or lesser degree? etc etc.
From this ppl decide if its worth their time learning all the bells and wistles of a particular program. Many times it's just plain laziness.

For example, I have never bothered learning Emacs - there are many alternatives that work just as well and easier to learn, and I dont consider it worth my time learning all the keyboard commands. The same goes for Latex - when I was writing my thesis I needed to include a lot of mathematical equations and formulas. I thought about doing it all in Latex because it would be faster than clicking formulas in MS Equation editor. But I reasoned it would take me more time learning Latex syntax than just using a tool I already master so I ended up clicking in Equation editor. Now, had I spent some time 5 years ago with Latex...
You know, this is all rather obvious when you think about, but thanks for the statistical verification!  It makes sense, because attractive people are almost always favored over ugly people in this society.  The disfavored (ie: ugly, black, poor) go into what they can: crime.
Yes, they certainly would!  Sadly those silly fight the power people seem nebulous because what they're fighting wouldn't be a problem if it weren't so nebulous, tenuous, and hard to define!  If it were obvious, then everyone would easily notice it and deal with it.

You can boil a frog to death in an open pot if you turn the heat up slow enough.  The same frog will jump out if you throw it in boiling water.  We are that frog, and the situation increasingly reminds me of [They Thought They Were Free; The Germans, 1933-45](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html).

Initially, the biggest impediment to correcting these nebulous, general social and governmental problems is a lack of knowledge.  This is precisely what Dwight Scarbrough seems to be fighting against.  He's taking the most high visibility thing in his life and using it to get people to think.  Just think.  He has no idea what else he can do, but at least he can tell people that he thinks things are wrong.  Don't diss his attempt.  He cares because he's seen the worst side of our government.  His increased sensitivity to these kinds of things is an asset to us all.  He's been in the pot when it was boiling.  He's someone who knows.
From the article:
&gt;while those rated unattractive were more likely to have done six of seven, *controlling for personal and family characteristics known to be associated with criminal behavior*.

Your correlation might be true (probably is), but the article was about investigating a stronger correlation.
If you get tired of the human interest story, skip to Page 4 for the science.
I've never used MS Equation editor, but when we were taught Latex at uni, we were warned about getting sucked into the presentation language and spending our time fine-tuning, optimizing or extending, instead of actually getting work done. This was good advice, I can imagine Latex being a trap for perfection-oriented people, it's very easy in Latex to feel that anything short of perfect elegance is unnacceptable.

people who get mad about this thing don't understand how trademarks and branding works.  This reminds me of the sambuck's coffee deal.  Some chick thought she'd be cute and name her coffee shop "sambuck's coffee", and acted all suprised when she got sued.

Companies are required to enforce their brands.  This may sound silly, but even though there may very little confusion between Dell, the computer maker, and Paul Dell's little web design company, they still have an obligation to enforce their trademarks.

If they do not, later down the line some company might REALLY try to rip Dell off, and when Dell takes them to court they can point at Dellwebsites and say "see!  Dell doesn't enforce their brand!"  You may laugh at this, but it's happened before (escalator lost their brand name because they didn't enforce it).

If a court does find with Paul Dell, then great!  Specific differences will be cited in a court ruling which will draw a clearer line.  Dell can continue to sue other people if it thinks they have gone too far.  You have to enforce your trademark, even in silly cases, or you loose it.
I didn't miss that it was an attempt at parody.  I was pointing out that it was an *inept* attempt at parody.

Suppose you're trying to parody Harry Potter, but you haven't read the Harry Potter books, so you think Harry Potter is a six-foot-tall boxer with a receding hairline.  Then you write a story in which two of Harry's friends are talking about how Harry can't represent Hogwarts in the Triwizard Tournament he has to visit his mom in Salisbury.  

See, it's not much of a joke; it's just dumb.


You make an excellent point.  Not only is it impossible to classify people into one of two buckets on the issue of how much time they are willing to spend learning tools, it is probably even impossible to place all of them at points on a continuum.  The two questions of whether you are willing to try better ways to work is orthogonal to whether you actually spend the time right now to  do them.  This can easily be illustrated by a pair of examples:  the easier one for the author to deal with is someone who neither does much work nor learns much.   The author would probably call them a lazy performance-oriented person.  The hard example is someone who knows that there are better technologies and methodologies out there, and puts them on a stack of things to check out.  So a guy who needs a particular program done immediately does it, and then learns better ways to do stuff when/if he has time later.  This person does not classify in the author's system.

What I think is interesting is that no-one has yet brought up the fact that this research was performed at Brigham Young University, the school that the LDS (Mormon) church owns and operates.
Anyone know a way to spoof your country so you can watch it?
I save my arguments for those who present arguments.  You only presented a rhetorical question ("So that makes our behavior right?") and a statement which contains a latent ad hominem attack of questioning my mental abilities ("Nice logic there, keylime").

As a result of considering the ad hominem attack in your initial comment and combining it with your criticism of ad hominem attacks in your second post, we see you (1) are not someone who thinks his posts through, (2) are a hypocrite, and (3) had no argument in your first post as substantiated by your assertion "The last resort of someone that doesn't have an argument, an ad hominem attack" (as I previously claimed).

You leapt to the conclusion that I support what has been happening Abu Ghraib when I actually did no such thing.  I observed that Iraqi prisoners there are treated better than American prisoners.

Anyone who argues to the contrary is asserting (for example) that having your head sawn off is better than being smeared with feces.

You didn't think about what I wrote, you jumped to your prejudiced conclusion, and now you can't retract it in face of the facts which are in black and white.
To be honest, I think that domain names registration needs to be a little tighter. Take a look at whitehouse.com or whitehouse.org. Those sites are plainly based on the idea of fooling consumers into thinking they've found whitehouse.gov. Along with yahooo.com and the rest, those should be shut down, since they aren't trying to make their own brand, they're preying on consumer confusion. Then there's things like paypa1.com, which are straight up fraudulent. 

On the other hand, a site like microsoft-sucks.com is fine, since it's perfectly clear to the consumer that the site is unaffiliated with the real MS.
On the face of it, that *sounds* like a great system: the court will find in favour of Paul Dell, and nobody can say Dell isn't vigorously defending its brand.

But what about when Paul Dell can't afford to risk his livelihood defending his rightful claim to his own name, and capitulates? Dell's half-hearted attempt to preserve its brand via a case it doesn't even expect or need to win ends up forcing a businessman to change his company's name, a serious setback for a budding startup if it ends up costing a lot of money.

Why, even if he wins the case, he loses due to the time he has to waste winning it. Even I think that system is unfair. I mean, for God's sake, the guy's father was named Dell, his father was named Dell, and so on - the guy shouldn't have to pay any penalty, time or money, for using that name.

Now, if there was real evidence that the guy was trying to make people think his company actually is Dell (e.g. his logo looks similar to theirs), then I would be completely on Dell's side.

SQL does all the nice things you described on one machine, in process. That's because we already have an OS running on that machine, and it has some locking primitives that the SQL engine library is using.

I don't agree with the "Extending that, conceptually, to multiple machines isn't that hard to do" - it's a hell of a lot harder: you have to implement some sort of distributed OS first, so you have locking over multiple machines.

Or maybe, if I am missing your point, can you please explain?

I do agree with you here, and certainly sympathize.  My family owns businesses and it's really annoying when someone tries to pull a slip-and-fall scam on you, or (in one case) floors their car in reverse and smashes into your building, and then sues you for the damage to their car.

That being said, hopefully these trademark deals work like every other law suit (i'm not quite sure), where if you win the other side pays for your fees and time.  I feel sorry for the little guy, but I also understand Dell's position.  Part of the cost of owning any business is defending yourself from lawsuits, frivolous or not...

Not quite. One of his contentions is that:
In particular, a person can be in one category with respect to a particular domain, and in the other with respect to another domain. Thus, I have seen professors in mathematics who were obviously perfection-oriented with respect to mathematics, be firmly in the performance-oriented category with respect to the efficient use of (say) word processors. It is almost a surrealistic experience to see a person in one situation full of intellectual curiosity and wanting to know everything about everything, and in another situation argue why you should not use a particular method that he himself does not know anything about, for reasons that are obviously totally artificial.

I skimmed through the bill and read 501, 502. Not being an American, and admitting my limited skill in legalese, I don't see how this bill would enshrine a two party system. It's not that I don't believe you, I'm just curious to hear why you feel this bill would enforce two parties only.
I don't think intellectuals are opposing capitalism.
Capitalism will only work if people are safe (minimum wage guarantee) and secure (social security).

&gt; Some of the most utilized code in the world, supporting
&gt; hundreds of millions of people daily, earning billions of
&gt; dollars, are unreadable pieces of write-only spagetti.

And that's why they're still sitting there - because they're unmaintainable. Rather than maintaining then, account managers cautiously wrap hackish layers around them rather than risk tinkering with them directly. It's an unstrategic position to be in.

&gt; Maximimizing utility (within cost constraints) is the
&gt; ultimate goal.

But for whom? An irresponsible programmer or PM who is working on the project under contract arrangements won't give a damn about maintenance issues. Particularly the sorts of people you get working at banks. Their goals don't mesh with the organisation's on this level.

&gt; That which gets the job done is more worthy.

A big part of the job is being able to maintain it.

I strongly dispute your direction. Code doesn't get to its destination due to particular utility or worthiness, it get there because that's what organisations deploy. That's the code that went in to do the job. A multinational banks sees an opportunity to realise profits by writing software that wholesales foreign exchange. The system that does in is a complete mess but allows them to realise this opportunity. They have to go with it because upper management are waiting on it and the option of not deploying is unthinkable. So they paper over the cracks and send it out. How can you believe that it wouldn't be better for that spaghetti system to have been an elegantly system, even in the medium term?

"people who get mad about this thing don't understand how trademarks and branding works"

Under English law a persons name cannot be trademarked.  I suspect that American and Spanish law is similar.  If so, people have every right to get mad about this sort of thing.

Domains are not brands. Sure, some are, but most are not, nor should they be. Tying them to brands is evil. They used to be tied to brands under the .es tld, in order to get a domain you needed to be a corporate person holding that trademark, or it needed to be your name, or you had to be a public entity representing the geographic place if it was a geographic place names, etc. As you can imagine, people didn't love .es domains then.

If you want to have the org, com and net domain, there's an easy fix: register the three of them.

Yep, fair is fair.

Java loads nearly 400 classes, allocates nearly 5000 objects (malloc is slow) and runs nearly 15000 methods before it can print "Hello, world!". But again, the JVM does much, much more than Ruby or Python - it has the whole JIT circus that greatly increases runtime performance. 

Another problem is the rt.jar (runtime) which is a zip file of ~750K which has to be unpacked into memory for every Java app that runs.

Also, Python libraries do get compiled to byte-code - the difference is just that Python .pyc files get interpreted by the Python interpreter, while Java .class files get JIT compiled, which means that the JVM makes native code out of the bytecode at runtime.

Well written, interesting thesis!
The Book of Mormon is about a third the size of the Bible.  

A more "plausible" explanation is that the guy who wrote it was trying to sound like the Bible, but went overboard, potentially due in part to the fact that (as the Smith-apologists are so fond of pointing out) he didn't exactly have the best formal education.
And they ban dog-sled mushers, men and women both.

HR4694 is inherently unconstitutional since it abridges the first amendment (freedom of speech).  Sections 501 and 502 anticipate that and state how the Constitution would be amended to make HR4694 no longer unconstitutional. (SEC. 501. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. and SEC. 502. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT DESCRIBED.)

HR4694 says in order to run you are required to pay for your campaign from a public fund.  In order qualify to collect from that fund you have to demonstrate a certain degree of popularity by either achieving a certain standing in the previous elections or by completing an (unlikely to succeed) petition.

Since it will be very difficult for any but the two established parties to meet the requirement needed to collect from the public find, third parties will not be able to run at all, since they cannot use funding from other sources.

Therefore, it would effectively enforce a two party system comprising the Democrats and GOP only.  Technically, a third party could run but the reality is there would be an overwhelming barrier to entry.

Without a third party running (in my case, the Libertarians) I have no way to express my views during the election process and therefore it is a violation of my first amendment right to freedom of speech.

I have no proof but my gut tells me the reason Democrats are sponsoring this legislation is because some/many of them blame Rapher Nader for splitting some Democrats off to vote for him, thereby costing the Democrats the election.

Could it be because with Latex you feel like your'e *programming* your document, instead of editing in a WYSIWYG editor, and because of that you need to write beautiful code?

I've used MS Word for over 10 years. It took me around 5-6 years to explore beyond the basics. Why? Because firstly I didn't know about advanced formatting so I never went looking for it (or what to look for). And 2nd, I didn't feel the need of advanced formatting until I started at the univ and needed to write longer (technical) documents.

So the way I see it the problem is two fold:
ppl don't explore new software because

* they don't know what to expect (for example using spaces instead of tabs when typing a document)
* they consider it not worth their time (which they'll maybe regret later when it's too late)

If you want your students to use a peace of software, introduce it's advantages and its functionality to them in a *short and concise fashion*. Tell them they will find it useful in the future aswell and how much time it'll save them. They'll pick up the rest by themselves.

"Communism and fascism go hand in hand, though, so no big surpise there" is absolutely right in that ultimately they are both forms of totalitarian governments.

People obsess over politics in a left v. right dichotomy or socialism v. capitalism axis.  However, the important axis is freedom v. slavery or anarchy v. totalitariansism.

Political power is a zero sum game.  For every power granted to a government the people lose freedom.  It doesn't matter if the people consider themselves to be better off as a result or not, the fact remains freedom is lost every time the government is given the power to enforce a rule.

Very few people are willing to admit they prefer being slaves to the state but the fact is, most people do prefer it.  Most people prefer having a portion their earnings forceably taken away in return for roads, schools, fire departments, etc.

Some would argue they are not slaves but the fact is a slave is given certain things by his master, things which are actually the result of the slave's labor, in return for protection by the master.  Depending on the master, some slaves are given certain freedoms such as where to work or who to marry but ultimately, the power resides in the master.

Being able to choose your master is not the same thing as being free from a master.

Some would say the Constitution protects Americans from being slaves by guaranteeing our freedoms and I would say the founding fathers did a good job of trying to make us as free as possible.  "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" combined with the statement that all rights not herein enunmerated are retained by the states and the people should have covered it pretty clearly.

However, the current interpretations of the general welfare clause and the interstate commerce clause, along with certain amendments like the income tax, have stripped us of the freedom we fought for and claimed over 200 years ago.

The reason most people are willing to accept a state of slavery  is because they have no faith in their neighbors.  They believe that their neighbors will not voluntarily contribute to the neighborhood's well-being and must, therefore, be forced.  By the way, those contributions are not necessarily financial.  They can be things like not being a racist or any other behavior typically deemed beneficial by the government which often uses the tax code to enact social engineering.

The loss of freedom by Americans is what is leading directly to the decline and fall of America.  The sort of ideal nation that used to come to mind when the word "America" was used is not possible when the citizens are slaves as slaves are a poor building material.

Europeans are no different at the end of the day as people are people everywhere you go.  Europe followed a different path and, as a result, has reached a slightly different destination (more socialist) but the important result is the same: we have all traded our freedom for mere material well being.
fuck the olympics, seriously.

or, fuck the IOC. bribery to get games in cities: check. banning things left and right for no good reason: check. blatant sexism in 2006: check. yeah, fuck the IOC, fuck their trademarks and copyrights too. fuck their TV deals and how they don't show 90% of the games. fuck 'em.

Superstar Chefs is a platform game similar to Mario Brothers or Bubble Bobble.
I agree the perception is that Republicans are bought.  However, it's interesting to note at http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.asp?order=A that all of the top ten campaign donors (1989-2002 election cycles) lean to the Democrats and one is on the fence.  Of the top twenty donors only three lean towards the Republicans and only one of them does so strongly.

That is NOT to say the GOP is not bought (as are the Democrats), it's merely an observation how the paying out is from concentrated sources for the Democrats and how there is a lot of spin involved.

Ultimately, the problem is not one of the Dems v. GOP, Labour v. Tories, or left v. right.  It's freedom v. slavery, the people v. their would-be masters.  Everything else is either a smokescreen or part of the confusion of war.

The only solution (and it would be temporary as history has shown) would be to dismantle government and return the power to the people.  Unfortunately, governments do not voluntarily relinquish power so, short of a violent revolution (perhaps triggered by a crisis caused by energy or religion?), I see no hope of the people regaining their freedom.
I agree that there are some scary similarities in the Bush admin's case but these are just left wing talking points.  In other words, it's a little weird reading about this coming from someone who believes in central planning.

Also if you do put in the time learn a new awesome technology such as LISP or LaTeX or how to configure your window manager, you are instantly biased towards that technology sometimes to the point where any time savings you 'feel' are completely bogus.

As an example, many years ago I spent the time to learn how to configure fvwm. It took me a couple of days, but then I got it setup *exactly* the way I wanted. I had SloppyFocus, but also set it up so that the various gadgets such as oclock never got focus. I had root terminals get a bright red frame as a warning. I could use the mouse wheel to quickly roll up windows to get them out of my way. Shift-arrow would shift between windows - much faster than the Windows-like default.

And I honestly believed that I was being really productive. It's called psychological commitment - the effort spent doing stuff like this has to be justified somehow.

Another, perhaps less obvious, example is the Unix shell. When you master the Unix command line, you are being really efficient - certainly you are much more productive than the slow gui tools, right? Because you can write stuff like 

   for x in (find &amp;^ *.png | grep sed | tr + ) ; do 

      autofoo %%$ (@@* - 120 + 32, 200 200)

   end;

   rm p*.png

and have all your images automatically scaled, cropped and mailed to your grandmother in mere *minutes*. Every Unix user knows how efficient the shell is. 

But every Unix user also knows what happens if you type "rm * .png" instead of "rm \*.png". The time required to repair such an incident is not accounted for when Unix wizards report how much more efficient they are. That's psychological commitment again - they blame themselves, not the tool, for the time. Eventhough the mistake *could not happen* in Windows. The time spent learning the arcane language has to be justified, and the easiest way in this case is to say "Oh, I screwed up. That was my fault, not because Unix is crap".

I guess what I'm saying is just that there are solid reasons to be suspicious of zealots trying to make you use their awesome new toy.

Great way to back up data.  Also, the comments on the site (www.digital501.com) have some suggestions regarding how to automate it.  I'm hoping to find some similar solutions for PC.
I want to be able to download a TV show with BitTorrent, and then load it onto my TiVo to watch.  When this technology becomes available, I won't need to use my computer for playback any more!
&gt; for x in (find &amp;^ *.png | grep sed | tr + ) ; do
&gt;
&gt;  autofoo %%$ (@@* - 120 + 32, 200 200)
&gt;
&gt; end;
&gt;
&gt; rm p*.png

Did you really get that right the first time, or did you *spend time* debugging the few lines of code (after frying your png files on the first try)?
You wouldn't have a discussion like that in a fascist or communist country. The list misses a basic characterisctic of those *totalitarian* twins.

Ski jump distances seem to be remarkably similar for women and men, if you take into account the smaller sample size for women.  See these [jump results from Lake Placid in December](http://www.skijumpeast.com/results/rslt06c.htm).  There are just 7 women in the competition, with 41 men.  The best two women jump better than the 8th place guy.  Given the very small number of women who seem to be learning to jump in the first place, this is somewhat remarkable.  Perhaps the old guard of the community don't want to see a woman beat the best men in the world.

It's also interesting that another field in which men and women are increasingly equal is long-distance running.  Ironically, the women's marathon was also banned until 1984, for "health reasons."  This occurred even as the best women in the world [were running times equal to those that the best men in the world ran less than 30 years before](http://www.marathonguide.com/history/records/).  Since then, the gap has narrowed considerably.  Women's times are around 108% of the best male times.
Easy money. :-)
Sorry, my agreement with you that there is no difference between the two parties in a system dominated by two parties slipped out of my reply.  You are absolutely right.

As to Democrats and Republicans fighting to the death over piddling differences: both parties are adept at the use of psychology to create a stong sense of identity in their members (rather like sports fans).  As a result, it is more important to the members to be perceived as a good party member than to be a good American (or Brit, or whatever).
The important thing is to write (beg, borrow, steal) the scheduler and RPC bit *once* and abstract it away from your application code... which usually means you invent a limited language for describing jobs. Just like SQL is a limited language for describing queries.

There's nothing inherent in SQL that confines it to one process. Concurrency means you have to give up knowing exactly when &amp; in what order sub-operations take place. If you do a join between million-row tables and slap a where clause on it, the query planner is free to do the clauses in whatever order it thinks will be faster. I'm talking about reads &amp; calculation right now -- things without side-effects like a render farm or search engine. Job failure can be handled by re-execution, or dumping, etc.

So much for reads. The real complexity comes when people try to implement transactional systems over many machines, say a hugemongous blog comment site or a multiplayer game with thousands of magic arrows flying about. At first look it seems impossible: how the fuck do we maintain consistent state? 

Mostly you don't. An individual user does not interact with the world as a whole -- only with her local frame... the story she's commenting on, the dragon that's chewing her arm off, etc. So one way is to design it like you would a large tennis tournament: a line judge and two players go off &amp; do their thing, and you compile the results as they come back. Instead of some every-sparrow-falls global judge, you have simple conversations that are run independently and recorded after-the-fact (usng simple conversations). 

The banking system does it this way &amp; they seem to do all right. That's why it's work to figure out someone's present net worth: it's not some number floating over their heads, it's a static slice of a dynamic process and it will never be exact.

On http://labs.google.com/papers/ they describe three layered systems: GFS, MapReduce and Sawzall. GFS is a clustered fileysytem; MapReduce is a job system;  Sawzall is an 'SQL-like' language that uses both to accomplish amazing things with very simple programs.
Just imagine, if someone else had found these we'd be looking at "angels" or "UFOs"!
Cool idea to make collaboration in every Excel cell.
There's an awesome little burger joint in Waterloo called the "Chill &amp; Grill." They were forced to change their official name to "The Grill" because of a conflict with the DQ "Grill n Chill" promotion of a few summers ago.

The local business had used the name long before, but can they  afford a stupid lawsuit to prove it? Easier to just change the sign outside, and leave the aprons and chairs as they've always been.
Nice article.  Although the author writes that there hasn't been any noticeable suppression of labor.  Here are a couple thoughts on the Bush Administration's suppression of organized labor:

First, when the Dept of Homeland Security was created, all the employees were forced to leave their unions in order to provide Bush with more "flexibility."

Second, Secretary of Education Ron Brown made an infamous comment where he referred to the NEA (the teacher's union) as a terrorist organization.


Think our government probably meets this criterion too.

I liked this, although the voice over is a bit over the top.


what do you mean Communism and Facism go hand in hand?  That makes no sense.  Was there a Communist regime near Rome when it became an Empire?
Actually that is not true.  U.S. backs Iran in Anti-Gay Vote:
(http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/25/iran12535.htm)
"Convicted paedophiles are often released — as was Mario M — on the basis of a psychiatric assessment concluding that they no longer represent a danger to society. These assessments have often been flawed and the released offenders frequently disappear from view."

Actually, as far as I know there is only a 2-5% reconviction rate, which is rather good.
It's absurd that people having committed these types of crimes are ever released.

I wonder... was the psychiatrist who recommended Mario M's release held responsible in any way for his actions against Stephanie?

I agree. The guy sounded like Michael Moore (not that that's always a bad thing) when all he had to do is take the citation and plead his case in court. Unnecessarily histrionic.

0.01% percent reconviction rate is way too high, in my opinion.  That is another innocent young life they get to ruin.  Someone else daughter or son they get to hurt.  Why do we try to "correct" these people?  What foolishness drives us to think they can be 'saved'?
I believe they were trying to make the point, communisms or facisms, they are different extremes that lead to the same ends.  Total control of the populations by an elite few.

People, stop modding comments down just because you disagree with them. That's the sort of stupid thing a scientologist or slashdotter would do. The parent (currently at -8) is articulate, concise, not off-topic. None of its replies have refuted it.

As a general heuristic, I mod down stuff I'm not interested in, or that I think others won't care about either. I don't mod down stuff just because I don't want it seen.

Just because somebody disagrees with you doesn't make them a troll. And not every messenger of a conspiracy is in on it, so cut that cop some slack as well.
My personal experience is that when you consider the alternative - to wit, that a guy with a known history of scamming people out of money by telling them that when he looked in a hat containing a magic rock he saw where treasure is buried, and would tell you if you would just pay him, was later telling the *truth* when he said that when he looked in a hat containing a magic rock it showed him an angel and a holy book of a brandy-spankin-new religion - your personal experience seems, frankly, laughably sad.
Um, take into account that some percent of *all* men commit sex crimes. I'm not sure what that is exactly, but I'm sure it's larger than 0.01%.

Most people are good.  They wouldn't do this.  Once they have crossed the line, do we slap them on the hand and release them so they can try it again?  What is the sense in this?  Why do you want to protect paedophiles?  It is not more important to protect children?

If the person is not, in fact, in violation of any statute, then yes.

I hate to break it to you pica, but capitalism isn't the answer for everything. Corporations held all power in the era of Social Darwinism, but that changed with the rise of monopoly busting and Organized Labor. The cycle has swung back the other way, but if Walmart and other companies continue to treat their employees as chattel, it will surely cycle again.

While on the surface this has the appearance of someone not paying for insurance and thus not getting coverage, this is really far more broken.  For things like basic public safety that everybody depends on, society should cover everyone, and incorporate the costs into taxes, since it is in everyone's interest to have this protection, and there is no reasonable justification that someone should be allowed to opt out.  This is something like everyone having to choose to pay a voluntary fee for police protection, and if they do not, crimes against them are ignored.  That the bureaucrats couldn't figure out how to incorporate the fees into property taxes (like they do virtually everywhere else in this country), and instead left a situation where fires could potentially burn down someone's property without coverage is positively dystopian.  

I can see how from a libertarian point of view this situation is acceptable, which is why the more extreme libertarians irritate me.  Their ideas don't even sound reasonable in theory, let alone practice.

Great info about financial stuff.
I hope you realize that the very fact that you as an American think of totalitarian and facist features of a country as communist features is a side-effect of your own countries propaganda during the cold war. 

Yes, there can be communist totalitarian countries but those two features are mostly unrelated. Capitalistic countries can be totalitarian or fascist in the same degree a communist country can.
Woah, talk about an emotional appeal. I was asking to see what percentage of sex offenders are reconvicted compared to nonoffenders, and you say that it doesn't matter. If it were a *lower* percentage, would we want to lock up all nonoffenders for being more dangerous?
I'm not anti welfare, I just think the government should provide it not businesses.  Should Wal*Mart hand out foodstamps too?

The government is already providing health care to WalMart employees through MediCaid. The government is indirectly subsidizing their so-called low prices.
I do avoid shopping at Wal-Mart because of their policies. But I also don't want any of the tax I pay being used to make-up for the lack of health care Wal-Mart provides. 

I wonder if Wal-Mart would be able to survive if there was no Medicaid? Wouldn't absenteeism get to a level that would hurt their efficiencies and increase costs?

REconviction implies they already were convicted once before for that crime. A 0.0% rate is a good goal for that I think.
I don't think it has much to do with American propaganda or being an American.  I think it has more to do with the fact that all Communist countries are actually totalitarian in fact.  See the Wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state

The totalitarian nature of the road to Communism is recognized by the phrase "dictatorship of the proletariat" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat  ) which is part of Marxist/Leninist political theory.

Fascism ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism ) and Communism ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism ) are two different political theories.  What they have in common is Totalitarianism ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism ).

The enemy of the people is Totalitarianism, regardless of the political theory that leads to it.

What a great reply.  

I think that many people are willing to accept a state of slavery because of a lack of faith in themselves, rather than their neighbours.  You have to have something that you want to do with your freedom, but when you do, you'll not give it up for anything in the world.
I guess it hasn't, because even my Macromedia Flash plugin is performing illegal operations now.
Quick Tip: If you dropped out of college to start a business, don't quote this statistic to your friends still in college. It will only make them feel bad about themselves and engender ill will towards you.
Thank you, you're very kind!  I agree that a lack of self-confidence is a contributing factor to the average person's desire to accept a state of slavery.

In the past, whenever I have discussed personal freedom with people, the objection I hear more than any other goes something like this: "This is all good for you and me but what about that guy?  He can't handle freedom like we can!".

As a result, I concluded a lack of faith in their neighbor is the main cause in the acceptance of a state of slavery.

However, the more I think about it, the more I think you may be onto something.  I'm definitely going to have to ponder on it for a while.

In the meantime, I'll observe that the social safety net enables us to ignore our neighbor and for him to ignore us.  This is very useful to politicians who want to divide and conquer.  It's nefarious: the politicians take our money, to create a safety net, which enables us to ignore our neighbors, which divides us and makes us easier for those same politicians to manipulate.

In effect, we're lambs being led to slaughter PLUS we're paying for the knife and butcher.  Worse yet, many of us have been convinced we got the better end of the deal!

Agreed.  They're hardly the only ones in government and even big business that do this, of course.  It's just that it's convenient for the source of this story to perpetuate the view that these guys are luddites because they work for what is falsely perceived as a Luddite Administration.  So they rely on "lesser" forms of communication that aren't time sinks and do not require them to carry Blackberrys?  I think this is true of most people who travel a lot and are constantly on the move.

Even if this discussion were limited only to the tech world, ask yourself this question: how much time do you think Steve Jobs spends answering email every day?  My guess would be less than writers for MSNBC do.
Knuth says:

&gt;My goal is to do this communication efficiently, in batch mode --- like, one day every three months.

The problem with this view is that--believe it or not--some of us have jobs that require change and communication on a more rapid scale.
I voted it down because it's soundbite history -- so brief and general it's either either tautological or wrong.
To push the point more politely, why not walk past the queue, receipt in hand?

This makes it clear that being asked to queue to have your stuff checked is unnacceptable - if the staff run after you then everybody else gets to walk through unhindered.
I'm not so sure that we are anywhere close to a resurgence of the labor movement.  Certainly, right now unions and unionized businesses are doing exceptionally poorly in the US.  On a larger scale, it seems that countries that are more unionized have recently tended to do poorly in comparison to the less unionized ones.  It is possible that unions were a transient, something that was necessary because there was still so much friction in the economic system, and that they are no longer needed.  

Further, WalMart is not treating people as chattels.  A chattel is a slave or a bit of personal property.  As far as I know, associates are free to quit whenever they want.  They don't get paid much, but what they do is not that hard, and does not require much in the way of qualifications, so it is not surprising that it is poorly compensated.
We can't respond to "soundbite" economics with "soundbite" history. That's harsh :)
I think the fact that no one else has ever done it in the 25 year history of the race is enough to call it significant.  Though yeah, it would be nice to know more details.

That's a pretty frightening goal for a lot of reasons, but mostly because the 'quick fix' would be to lock all these people away forever. The high emotional index leads to disastrous knee-jerk reactions.

For example, the manditory drug sentences that haunted the US for 20 years, putting minor folk away for decades while the volume dealers went free. Not to mention that 
an unknown but signifigant % of people are wrongly convicted.

Those last few percent are what cost the most. There's not a simple answer.
Tempest in a teapot, and an egregious waste of time to boot, especially considering the writer's original complaint about wasting a few mere minutes during the checkout process, when compared to the extra days if not weeks spent on chronicling this.

Saddam had money enough for health, but chose to invest in arms and keep the population hostage. All the more reason to topple him. Once the post-war stats start coming in, you'll see improvement.
I'm skeptical of (shii's) 0.01% figure. Consider that that means one in every ten thousand men is criminal of the kind discussed in the story.

Seem low? What about a city like Toronto, with a population of 4.5 million. Half are women, and say a third of the remaining men are too young or old... that's still 0.01% of 1.5 million, or 150.

Yes, chattel slavery seems to contradict capitalism in the abstract, which is more about wage slavery. I've heard that a large component of the Civil War was the clash between these two models. (Though unfortunately I know little about the war beyond what I learned in school, which was largely a dry recitation of the military aspects and irrelevant political speeches).

However, Wal-Mart simply receives too much corporate welfare to justifiably say "Love it or leave it." They frequently gain grants for building new stores, on the promise of increasing employment; tax breaks despite using local/state government resources; pushing off employee medical costs onto governments. And so forth. (And if we're talking about capitalism in the abstract, the notion of a corporation seems to be a distortion of capitalism; they tend to have greater human rights than normal humans).

So when someone says, "The employee is free to start their own Wal-Mart beater!" that seems to misunderstand capitalism; Adam Smith even explained the unlikelihood of a wage employee saving enough capital to start their own business. Much less Wal-Mart, which of course tries to kick away any ladder that new competitors attempt to climb behind them.

It's often Nader and Libertarians who seem to campaign for small business. Not the mainstream politicians.
Yes. If you're disagreeing with soundbite econ, you're held to a higher standard. Which I think is good -- you should, given that you have the opportunity to take the extra moment and write a little more, point to sources where people can look.

Sure, it's a filter if we're talking about a 5 minute debate segment like on Hardball or whatever, where you don't have time to bring out context. But here you can at least link to something cogent.
I'm waiting for the word "iPod" replacing "MP3 Player" in conversations. That would be an ultimate step to market dominance for Apple.
This is a composite, as the world is never dark all at the same time.
Yeah, on both sides, so that's not really an argument.

 Biking can make men sterile, on which there's also no utterly robust data since it's long term. That doesn't mean the Tour de France shouldn't exist. 

The "It's like juming down a whole lot" -&gt; "It's worse for women than for men" thing is just weird. True, you can intuitively argue things either way that have no necessary semblance to reality, but a google gave me CBS' article and, in fact, *"For women, this could have serious affect on the uterus and abdomen — or so doctors thought, until recently."*

Of course, putting these things on has to make economic sense. If only half a dozen are serious competitors as suggested then it's not necessarily a good investment - if you want to split the men and women's events; it wouldn't hurt to use the same course for an hour or two more, especially with olympics when it's there anyway.

I don't think olympic organizers should decide they know better than the dozens of sports organisations that make this simply a sport practiced by women. Things they're not responsible for - decisions about whether you should *allow* someone to take a possible risk. There are, what, at least half a dozen of extreme sports that pose more risk to men and women alike than this to women.
I don't care how flawed the study was &amp;mdash; that's pathetic.  I've had one semester of economics during which I was bored silly, and I had no trouble answering that question.
I agree completely, especially about the resource hogging part. You just want to have Quicktime, and what do you get? an annoying tasktray icon and several services running in the background.

I don't think bluetooth is needed for an iPod, but I think the author has a point: I think the iPod should just exit gracefully and cleanup when you pull it out instead of displaying a "don't disconnect" message.

But it's forbidden now to criticize the oh-so-great Apple.

Indeed. It is of bias instead, as your wildly inaccurate summary also suggests.
Yes, the sanctions did have the effect of strengthening Hussein domestically. Brings to mind a notorious interview with Clinton's secretary of state:

*Lesley Stahl on U.S. sanctions against Iraq:* We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?

*Secretary of State Madeleine Albright:* I think this is a very hard choice, but the price--we think the price is worth it.

-- 60 Minutes (5/12/96)
Heh. It would work. 

It would still sort of be acknowledging a system built on distrusting both employees and customers, suggesting theft as a fact of life, and trust as not something you can generally expect. It makes managerial sense but sense a skewed message.

Perhaps a rule to see if 2 links are equal?

For example 2 different google video links could point to the same video, but differ based on the query string. Perhaps reddit could ignore any '?q=*' part of a google video url. The disadvatage of this is that it would have to be hard coded for google video and repeated for many URLs.

What's this supposed to mean?
Ok, so if I go to Clapton, I would save the $40 that I would have spent on Dylan.  In my book that is $40 in my pocket. 

If I'm stupid enough to be willing to pay more for something than its market value, how can I use that as the basis for computing an opportunity cost?

Maybe I should stick to engineering
So long as they are small or you can disable them.
Explaination: The purpose of reddit is to find new things online (right?). Some times people will post (in the comments) links that are similar to the current story.

My suggested 'Similar links' would allow anyone to attach a link/links to a story. When you view the info on the link it would show *some* of the links suggested (perhaps about 5). The 5 links shown would be randomly choosen (or at least have a high random factor) to prevent group think.

This is different from the [detect duplicates](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=21oy) suggestion. This is for similar links, that is for identical links.

This would also improve the recommendation system.
How to detect duplicates?  A page can have several URLs and the content may differ due to ads for example.  A first step may be to strip the mark-up.  Then you can measure the string/edit distance ([Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)) to all other existing entries.  If the distance is sufficiently small, you assume that the pages are identical.  However there are some problems with this approach: 1.) The computation would be very expensive (compute distance * number of entries) and 2.) you need the full text of all documents.

Therefore a better approach might be to use some clustering technique ([clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering)).  The process goes roughly like this: extract some features from the text (e.g. word frequencies) and use them to position the document in a vector space.  The idea is now that if you already have an entry for this document, you would find its corresponding vector exactly at the place of the new vector (or really close to it).  This solves both above-mentioned problems:  1.) The complexity doesn't depend on the number of entries anymore and 2.) you don't need the full text of all documents but only the vectors.  (The first one isn't obvious:  You may argue that you have to compare a vector to all other vectors to determine whether there is a vector close enough.  But there exist some smart tricks to prevent that.)
(Just like many economists, I'm not an economist, so I hope someone corrects any mistakes in my explanation.)

My understanding is that an ["opportunity cost"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) is the net value of the next-best alternative to what you're currently considering. What is the net value of watching Dylan?

*value(you, dylanticket) - cost(you, dylanticket)*

The value of the ticket is relative to you (the "you" in the problem) -- your value of it approaches $50. Subtract the cost, which Ticketmaster or some market sets at $40; and you're left with $10 of value from the transaction.

What is the net value of Clapton?

*value(you, claptonticket) - cost(you, claptonticket)*

The question doesn't specify how much you value the Clapton ticket. Let's say you value it less than a Dylan ticket, so that it approaches $40. Fortunately, the purchase cost is $0, so the net value is $40.


Of course, this all assumes you have some weird *value()* function which maps your internal/social benefits from music concerts into dollars. Squishy "science," this economics seems. And I think one job of advertising is to mess with this function.
really? what about at night?
See my proposal on clustering techniques to solve the duplicate-links problem.  Clustering could be used to tackle this problem as well.  (In a similar way as Google News groups related stories.) http://features.reddit.com/goto?id=21oy

"""Where does Bill Clinton's Monica Lewinsky scandal rank? Many scholars said it belonged at No. 10..."""

The only argument that would support your proposal would be a proof showing that really good stories don't make it on reddit. But this would as well be the proof that the whole reddit system doesn't work.

What is a good story? I would say that one of the main assumptions of reddit is that a story is (by definition!) good if it gets high scores, and that it's bad otherwise. Under this assumption your problem actually doesn't exist. If this assumption doesn't hold, reddit is flawed.

might be useful as a sort of trash can not that I dislike paulgraham.com far from it but now people are reposting specific articles by appending a bogus query string it's really gotten out of hand
Just make the karma go back to zero after an edit, and the problem goes away. It'll only be good for "Oh s---, I misspelled that!" quick edits that way.

Oh yes! All those US-only-issues are driving me insane. As I refuse to watch TV, I seem to be a lot more informed on American news than about what happens in my own city up here in Viking-land.

Anyway, it might be an idea to sort away issues only of interest to a particular nation. Requires a large amount of users, though, and perhaps a bookmark system so that each user can easily access the subareas that he/she is interested in. Or not. Could lead to some sort of featurism. In any case, the reddit guys seem to know what they are doing.

I think it would be much more democratic no to do that. This could polarize the news of reddit to the interests of the most active users.

If a new user submits a great content, I think it shouldn't be in disadvantage in comparison to something submitted by an active user. (Unless one wants to break the democratic editorial system which seems to work fine until now.)
A lot of dupes could be eliminated without looking at the text at all -- just computing edit distance on the URL and title is enough in many cases. Digg seems to do something like this.
A site like [Arts and Letters Daily](http://www.aldaily.com/), but updated faster. It's sort of high brow-ish commentary, essays, and such.
This one's an excellent argument for itself.
The kid is eight years old, it's way too late to start cutting off bits his mother doesn't like now. This should have been done approximately 8 years ago.
As others have suggested, it would be nice to see stories that were selected by blending the algorithms Hot, New, and Top. For example, Top means "The top stories, regardless of age.", which can be thought of as 100% Top, 0% New. Then there's the New section, which is like "The newest stories, regardless of score." I'd like to be able to say, "I want the top stories that are at least kinda new" and so on. The most natural UI for this seems to be a dragbar, like Google Maps uses to zoom in.
It would be nice to see a list of the top n people with tastes most similar to mine, so that i could see what they upvoted. An additional perk on the "what they upvoted" page would be a way to filter out the links i already saw, so i could see: Here's a bunch of stuff that you haven't seen before, but other people like you liked. I guess it's like the Recommended page but with more transparency.

It would be nice if this also factored out the ratings of users you don't like.
If 'recommended' would actually work, you wouldn't have to see stuff you aren't interested in.

Every n minutes, you could dump a snapshot of the first, say, ten pages of Hot, New, and Top to static HTML files. This way, when the database crashes, we can at least have some functionality. I get the shakes when there's no reddit! A little functionality is better than none.
I'd rather invest a dollar in reddit.
If there's, say, an Olympics subreddit, i might not check it all that often. But there may be a really hot Olympic story, and if it's hot enough, it should transcend the subreddit and make it to the main page.

Some may argue, "But if the story is big enough, someone will submit it for the main reddit anyway!" But why have two seperate stories?
The phrase you are looking for is 'fundamentalist christians and muslims'. Hope this helps :@}

After my son Enea was born I started to require less time to concentrate
again after an interruption, now, 5 years later, I continue to take very little
time to concentrate after an interruption, even as little as 60/120 seconds,
so I guess the time needed to concentrate again after interruption is something that can be changed with pratice.

It's not his main point, but the author's also right that public financing is essential.

For better or worse, a political operation is a business, along with being something else. It needs money to get its message out. If it doesn't get enough money, it goes out of business. Businesses serve their customers.

So who should politicians serve? The public, or those who collect and give money to them?

You can't use the similar links to train your filter if they are posted in the comments.
Yes they are similar. I view 2 links to the same story to be a bug in how reddit stores links. Whereas I view the ability to see similar links (based on a human's POV) to be a feature. :)

Same could be done for Recommended. You then have a 3D space of weighting for stories. A triangle with corners labeled 'Top', 'New' and 'Recommended' would allow you to select what weighting. What is 'Hot' now would be 50% Top, 50% New, 0% Recommended, etc.
I noticed this when browsing *.reddit.com. When I go to the info page for a story (like this page), and I want to get back to features.reddit.com, I have to edit the URL or do a few click through 'subreddits'.

You are matching "commas" (plural) with "a semicolon" (singular) or "a period" (singular). I think you should have said, "What is this trend of using **a comma** when a semicolon or a period is required?"

Of course I got the state of flow on my own but it was often with something like gaming. Something that helps you find the state but isn't productive on it's own, apart from the relaxation you get from it.

I really got flow after I listened to the guys who teach attraction and seduction of women. The key for me was David DeAngelo's "Double your Dating" because he came from the angle of genetics, evolutionary psychology and other things that I had researched. I was convinced about the truth of what he started to tell so I thought to myself: "I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, for now".

Later on, I also watched and read a colleague of his, Ross Jeffries. He's much better at expressing himself and explaining things more clearly. A better way to think about the world. But if you come from where I came from, it's better to start at David DeAngelo.

There are other ways of getting into flow state. Like gaming, sports, coding etc. This is just a suggestion,

that will get you laid.

Hm, you are right, but how to deal with cases like the following:

* http://server.com/story?id=1000&amp;style=classic
* http://server.com/story?id=1001&amp;style=classic
* http://server.com/story?id=1001

The distance between the first two is smaller than the distance between the second and the third.

Do you mean the title of the reddit entry or of the linked document itself?  The titles of the reddit entries vary a lot for duplicates.  But maybe the content of the title-tag of the document combined with the edit distance of the URLs could do it in many cases.  But again: calculating the edit distances for maybe 40000 URLs isn't done in a second.

Unlike other satelite photos where they take pictures of the entire surface of the Earth at once............. !?
Have a "subreddit" tab on the front page which is drag-over, drop-down so you can select the subreddit of your choice.
This is cool!  Like Googles [Zeitgeist](http://www.server.com/story/1000?style=classic).  And we wouldn't have to see ancient articles by Paul Graham on top of the list all the time.
It would be useful even if it just suggested "this story might already have been submitted" without having to be 100% sure on the equality of the URLs. I think a lot of times submitting the same story twice is accidental. So if when you submitted a URL, if reddit thought it was a dup, it could show the form again with a message saying "We think it's a dup to this other story"
On one page I pointed this tool at, it picked up two obscure colors defined in the CSS and ignored the main page colors, such as the body background color and nav bar background color.
It's a community driven website, and it's the community that will notice these things and it's the community that will prevent it from happening.

Sure, someone might get a brief karma boost by doing this on a regular basis, but after a few submissions the regular visitors will wise up and "punish" them with their votes.  That's how it works.
Try re-submitting the idea with a more descriptive name; it's a good one.

Honest and interesting.
Is this really so uninteresting that it needs to be modded to negative numbers ?
Exactly. The problem with the "Top" page is it's increasingly difficult for new links to make it to the front page. The links that are already there still gain votes and the other top voted pages lie somewhere 2-5 pages back. Links on the "Hot" page are lucky to stay visible for 2 days. That leaves a huge gap of visibility between the "Hot" page and the "Top" page for links that are highly voted but don't have the 700 points needed to beat out Paul Grahm.
this would be nice. right now, it seems like the clicking on a user only shows their submissions/comments/etc. for that sub-reddit. It would be better to have a single user profile page that somehow divides between sections (or maybe not) that having to hand-edit the URL to go from "features.reddit.com/user/FooBar/" to "http://reddit.com/user/FooBar/".

Reddit and del.icio.us are somewhat orthogonal.  Let's make use of this!
I'd originally thought that voting up/down a story was whether you liked it and would want it to be more popular. In one comment somewhere PG stated that voting was really just a way to train a filter on what reddit should show you.

I get the feeling that there are reddit features I'm missing. I would really like to better train "my reddit" to ignore links that are just submissions of joel/PG/guy blog posts, and understanding how voting influences what is recommended would be helpful.

Well, you can buy some shirts (and thongs) from them for which they get a "minor-profit":

Instead of automatically saving all links to del.icio.us have a button that will automatically do it for you. That way people who don't use del.icio.us or don't want to save that link to their del.icio.us account can simply save it on reddit, and those who want to del.icio.us it can push a "save to del.icio.us" button.
kde
Tags have there place, but not here.
Or you have an option in the prefs that determines what the [save]-button will do.
It seems like reddit has (mostly) avoided categories or tags so far, but instead of having requests for new subreddits (which will likely be "programming", "politics", etc.), why not allow a story submitter choose a category? That would make it simple to have "politics.reddit.com" without needing a whole seperate reddit to browse to before you submit a story. 

And even if a "politics.reddit.com" was created using the request for subreddit, plenty of political stories will appear on the normal reddit. Seems like having a system to optionally choose a category would make it easy to break up subreddits. (I think tags would make it more fragmented, which is why I suggest reddit defining the top-level categories.)

200 miles is only just over 300 kilometres, which is a stone's throw with a couple of skips at the end as far as nukes are concerned. so i wonder what exactly this means?

* pakistan has some very low-yield nuclear warheads, such that it's okay to have your own guys standing 200 miles from ground zero, because there won't be much fallout to worry about;
* pakistan considers its soldiers and missile techs to be mostly expendable cannon fodder, and they're the only ones who'll ever worry about the fallout;
* pakistan considers its borders to be so close together, and any possible theatres of combat so small, that long-range capacity would be superfluous anyway; or,
* pakistan thinks the prevailing wind patterns are such that the fallout would always land on india anyway.

hmm, hmm...

EDIT: the title's actually wrong - this thing's range is only 200 *kilometres*, less than 150 miles! it's not quite a nuclear slingshot, but it's not much better than a nuclear bazooka, either. i'll have to consider one last alternative, namely:

* the pakistanis are stark staring lunatic.

Very interesting! Not the things said in the article (I was already familiar with these concepts), but rather the date on it.

See, Paul Graham spoke a bit about how hackers need to concentrate in a July 2004 talk at OsCon: http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html And Joel Spolsky beat Paul to the punch way back in August of 2000, with point 8 of his "12 Steps to Better Code": http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html Indeed, I still find Joel's version the one most likely to convince a skeptic, because of the way he does the math with Mutt and Jeff.

But I see that this article by Lars Wirzenius dates back to *February* of 2000, predating Joel by a full 6 months. I wonder if it was Joel's (or Paul's) inspiration, or if all three are simply re-stating the same idea because it's so important to hackers?

In this way you could simultaneously down vote the specific article for whatever reason, and up vote the topic to train your filter. Only the content vote would be public.

Too complicated for such a simple process.  earthboundkid's idea or a simple time limit is the simplest, easiest practical solution.

Being able to vote links up *and* down is a big part of what makes reddit different. I think the same system would work well for elections; I have found myself in the position of voting for a candidate I dislike just because that's the only practical way to vote **against** a candidate I really hate. Bidirectional approval voting would give me a way to vote against a candidate explicitly without having to vote for anyone I don't like. It also has the advantage of allowing multiple positive votes, allowing the voter to express several preferences.
Better than a simple plurality.  Plurality voting is very heavily biased toward a two-party system, whereas approval voting at least gives third parties a chance.

Can you tell I'm a disgruntled libertarian?
[deleted]
So we can raise awareness that this guy is an idiot?

Never mind. Apparently Reddit people don't get that sort of subtlety - point taken.
I don't think that negative campaigning is necessarily a bad thing.  It's just more information about the candidate, which you can verify on your own (not that people generally do).

I think it would be great if campaigns were all negative.  People would start to realize that *every* vote is for the lesser of two evils, and maybe start to look at alternatives to government :)
The OP had a question about Julian Barbour's "End of Time".  Barbour is a physicist with an iconclastic view of the nature of spacetime.  He views the perception of reality as a string of jumps from one frozen configuration of energy in spacetime to another.  Each of these "time capsules" contains a complete history of its past.

However, the reply by Tom (who hasn't read the book) didn't really respond to the question.  As you say, it's mostly pontificating.  However, the quotes from the Buddhist sources are quite interesting, and many of them are entirely consistent with Barbour's thesis. Tom does present what amounts to a dual of Barbour's thesis: "...the way that's experienced is that you feel that you (Buddha Mind) are absolutely still in the midst of a world of absolute motion..."
  
In Barbour's view, you are jumping through independent worlds of absolute stillness.

All worlds energetically allowable exist.  Transitions between them are those with the highest probability, and the transitions may not be unique.

I recommend Barbour's book:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195145925/qid=1140375254/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-9273098-8804053?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155
I agree, and I think the downvote option would be even more favorable to smaller parties. I think it would also help keep any party from getting too big.
Such a system wouldn't make big difference in elections like USA's, where only 2 parties compete.
But in elections where there are 3, 4 or more parties, this would allow to draw off parties getting relatively many votes, but that everybody else hate.

I remember reading somewhere that at his time, Hitler was elected by only about one third of voices. But as with these votes he had more than any other party, he was elected Chancelor.. With a "Reddit-like" vote, maybe the other 2/3 of the population would have voted against nazis, who would have never come to power...
kind of silly thing to do. modding down doesn't affect karma, but I generally delete my posts that go below 0 because it gives me the impression that people get upset when they read them.

What I found strange is that there is no mention of the opportunities for the activities. It seems to me that if there is a Dylan concert tomorrow for $30, that changes everything. Is it really enough to say that I would be willing to pay $50? What if Dylan concerts normally cost $100. Is it even meaningful to say that a Dylan concert is worth $50 to me, since this presumes I would go to it if I could buy tickets for $50 (and there were no other big opportunity costs ha ha), so it must be worth somewhat more than $50....

So I guess what I didn't like was making the problem "real-world" enough that you thought more about it, rather than keeping it strictly clean and theoretical, which the concept seems to require. (Since the concept seems to be an  oversimplification that only has limited utility)

Isn't ratpoision a dead project?  i.e.  Didn't one of the developers decide that rewriting it in a lisp dialect was a better idea?
I don't know about the quality of the 'opportunity cost' question, but their answer to the 'Monty Hall' problem is wrong!  The question, as stated, does not provide enough information to come to definite conclusion.  Their *answer* partly addresses this by stating that Monty knows what is behind each door.  That should have been stated in the question,right?  But the answer even with this assumption is still incomplete.   Not only do we need to know what information Monty knows, but also his *intention*.  
If he intends for you to loose, he would have only given the chance to switch in the case that you had chosen correctly the first  time.  If he wants you to win, he will only give you a chance to choose again if had chosen incorrectly the first time.  If he doesn't care if you win or lose, it matters both that he knows the correct door and that he intentionly uncovers a door that he knows is incorrect.  What are the 'odds' that Monty wants you to win?  Who knows? Perhaps it depends on how many sponsored prizes have already been won in this show.
"SO WHAT, exactly, is the Web 2.0 movement? As an ideology, it is based upon a series of ethical assumptions about media, culture, and technology. It worships the creative amateur: the self-taught filmmaker, the dorm-room musician, the unpublished writer. It suggests that everyone--even the most poorly educated and inarticulate amongst us--can and should use digital media to express and realize themselves."

Um, sonds like the plain ol' Internet to me.  

And I get  profound sense of irony from this article.  Were it not for the Internet reducing the barriers to entry, Andrew Keen might have a very tough time getting published.
What you suggested might be better, but what I wrote was grammatical, clear, and punctuated as helpfully as any written English sentence might be.  It was not more difficult to read than it had to be.  Your observation was an aesthetic one, and not one about function.

Consider, however, the sentence "However, the underlying idea that most economists are clueless still stands, for real economics take a look at the Austrian School, most convincingly at mises.org".  When reading the word "for", many readers will assume that it is there as a conjunction, in the sense of "since" or "believe", when in fact it is a preposition.  Certainly we can all get used to doing this kind of deciphering, but if standard orthography works better, why mess with it?  Or why not learn it?

Anyhow, it only seems like a trend because I've been encountering it more.  I learned about avoiding run-on sentences in 2nd grade.  At a school called John Curtis Christian School in New Orleans where all that anyone seemed to care about was football.  Maybe they just don't teach this kind of thing anymore.
"But if a believer demands that I, as a nonbeliever, observe his taboos in the public domain, he is not asking for my respect, but for my submission."

That seems to sum things up nicely.

Simple approval voting, vote for everyone you like and don't vote for those you dislike, would result in the same outcome for "all" elections.  The "disapprove" vote is implied with the absence of approval.  There is no reason to complicate the lives of voting officials, volunteers of mixed mathematical background, any more than is necessary.

Personally, I think Condorcet voting is far more elegant when there multiple candidates to choose from, both in the expression of opinion and the method of vote counting.  (You don't need a computer, unlike IRV.) If you always include a "None of the Above" option.  Rank your "approved" candidates in the order of preference, then rank the "None of the Above" vote higher than those you disapprove of.  Slightly more complicated than simple approval voting, but worth it, IMHO.

There's a world between a spy-plane or an EM wave interception program and the technology described in this article. Not necessarily getting the components to work, but the systems concept itself... and then actually finding things in the data. The author must be properly paranoid.


From the article:

&gt; The 21-page brief filed by the Mountain View search giant angrily dissected the government's claim that the search results would produce useful evidence regarding child pornography.

And in the very next paragraph:

&gt; The law is designed to keep children from sexually explicit material on the Internet.

Sigh...


According to the Pali Canon, Gautama did gain knowledge of far more than he taught. He taught was what was deemed essential to overcome suffering:

"In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous [than what I have taught]. And why haven't I taught them? Because they are not connected with the goal, do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That is why I have not taught them. (Simsapa Sutta, http://accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn56-031.html)

My he's paranoid.  So discussion of Western colonialism is diffusing Stalinist memes. Rather fortunate for the colonists, that.

Actually I think getting rid of parties completely wouldn't be the worst idea. It would eliminate the worst part of current voting systems, the fact that you have to buy an all-in-one package of opinions from a very small sample size.

I am also not that sure regional voting is such a great idea. After all most really interesting issues are not regional.

Not that big of a deal, but there is no link back to the main reddit page anywhere once you are on a subreddit.
well, to be fair, removing the female clitoris is more similar to removing the entire male glans - the foreskin and the entire part of the penis normally covered by the foreskin.

in that sense, female "circumcision" is really grossly misnamed, in a way that might make it seem less brutal than it is. a more exact female equivalent of male circumcision would be removing just the clitoral hood. that too would be a pointless and unnecessary operation, but if that was all that was done, i doubt too many people would be upset about it.

I completely agree with you that good punctuation makes things easier to read. I'm all for it. The reason I looked for an error in your sentence was that there's a law (I forget its name) that states that anyone who corrects someone's grammar on an online forum will make at least one mistake of their own. It's amusing to see how often it holds true. It usually does, perhaps in 9/10 times.

Very impreesive! But take a look at an earlier proposal:

Is it just for computer-generated proofs? Often times the only proofs in papers I see use simple techniques like induction, contradiction, or whatever. They are as objectively correct or incorrect as ever.

In some ways, IRV is actually worse than plurality.  For example, IRV is pretty much the only well-known voting system that fails the monotonicity criterion: it is possible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher, and to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking him lower.

A Condorcet method is probably better than IRV for single seat elections.  It uses the same ranked ballots as IRV, it also eliminates "spoilers", but it is more resistant to tactical voting and is easier to count.

I believe in reddit -- it's the most addictive website I've encountered, and the core technology could probably be applied to lots of other subject areas, like politics.  I'd consider investing if there were a way to do so.  I'm not sure the owners would benefit from selling stock, though -- they seem to  be doing fine with what resources they have and probably don't want outsiders exerting influence on how they run their business.
I think some subreddits are a good idea.  In particular, it might be wise to separate politics from technology news.  But one thing I like about reddit is that it has become one-stop shopping for all my finding-cool-shit-online needs.  If you create lots of subreddits, it compromises that convenience.
On second thought, lots of subreddits would be fine if there were a way to get the mathematical union of the subreddits that I want to read.  Maybe a list of subreddits in the preference section, with checkboxes to select the ones I want to read.

Subreddits are pages like features.reddit.com or sub.reddit.com where there are a list of links that can be voted up or down, each with a comments page. I don't suggest each have it's own subdomain though.

You have to put in consideration who published the Cartoons before you can make a conclusion about the purpose. People outside Scandinavia may not know that Denmark has a mayor upswing in anti-immigration laws recently. Denmark is at the moment one of Europe’s most racist countries and Jyllands-Posten is Denmark’s most racist news paper. When you consider that then the cartoons seems a little more than just an expression of free speech or a fight against religious submission. I think the Muslims around the world got the message loud and clear (as it was intended): Denmark, and most notably Jyllands-Posten, doesn’t like Muslims. 

Second newspaper in Europe to publish the cartoons was a Christian news paper in Norway. Cartoons have null to do free speech, its all about religion and the fact that in general Muslims and Christians don’t like each other. 

I guess you could allow it until someone had either voted or followed your link. Kind of like how in pinball you get another ball if you immediately sink.

Calling JP a racistic news paper is, well, at best uninformed.

JP is a serious news paper. In fact of the danish news papers it is the one with the highest sales numbers on a 
daily basis. 

That's something I like too - always being surprised by the variety of topics that come up.  Creating separate subreddits in subdomains seems to be a somewhat awkward way of doing categorization... leads to fragmentation and navigation difficulties that don't really need to be there (though it makes sense for nsfw).  

Might be better to have a limited set of tags approved by the redditmasters, and let the submitter optionally choose one or two for each post. Then the reader can just browse through everything, or choose to filter by a subset or union of tags.  New tag requests can always be added in the request section.
Actually, you might eventually sew what you reap, if it happens to be flax you're harvesting.


Uh huh.

I'm not even sure if it's worth replying to your post, since it's unclear at what point you go to full tongue-in-cheek mode. However, the problem with negative campaigning is that it becomes less about the actual platforms and issues, and more about personal attacks. ("The guy can't even tie his tie right, how can he lead your country?!")
In your opinion what mayor news paper in denmark is the most racist then? Maybe you dont feel that the danish Folkpartiet is racist either?

Problem with Condorcet is explaining it to people. It requires a fair bit of voter education. Approval-voting is so much simpler to explain ("tick as many candidates as you like" ... see?) and still retains many of the ideal voting attributes.
One thing I've been a bit concerned about with reddit is the creeping in of overtly political articles, usually about US issues, almost alwayus from a Democratic viewpoint. I don't care about US politics, and would like a version of reddit that didn't contain multiple references to conspiracy theories derived from Cheney shooting people - if such a thing is possible to engineer, all the better.

I'm inclined to agree about parties. I see their effect as harmful overall. It's not so much that I think they shouldn't exist, but I think they shouldn't have official recognition.
Why is Google still keeping GMail in beta?  Because they can?  Maybe your software should stay in beta too.
Shii's figure was 2-5%.  Asardar was the one who came up with a 0.01% figure, saying it would "still be too high".  Shii was pointing out that if pedophiles had  0.01% recidivism rate, they would be (mathematically) significantly less dangerous than the population as a whole, as fewer sex criminals would commit future sex crimes than newborn boys.  The important figure, when determining how dangerous a group is, is their crime rate *relative* to the population as a whole.
Reminds me of a quote I found on a Lisp discussion board a while back... if I find the link again I'll post it.  It went something like this:  "Lisp is better than sex.  I know - 18 year old me gave up many opportunities for sex to hack on her Lisp macros."
I was just about to quote that exact sentence when I saw your  comment! He could not have put this more eloquenty. I'm just hoping nobody tries to pull a Theo van Gogh on him.

"In the words of the Somali-born Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the integration of Muslims into European societies has been sped up by 300 years due to the cartoons; perhaps we do not need to fight the battle for the Enlightenment all over again in Europe."
Wonder what Chaitin thinks about that..
Only the first time. After that, people would start throwing their disapproval votes at the lesser parties with which they conflict.

In Canada, the Green party probably stands to benefit the most, since no one would actually *cast* a negative vote against the environmentalists. Meanwhile, the New Democrats would be completely buried, since nearly every Conservative voter would also cast a negative on the NDP.
"When a politician says his opponent is mistaken, that's a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a statement as 'divisive' or 'racially insensitive' instead of arguing that it's false, we should start paying attention."

That's Paul Graham, in [What You Can't Say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html).

When I read essays like that, I get the impression that it will be no challenge for me to apply these ideas in day-to-day life - at the time they seem to follow so naturally from the thread of his argument. But in the muddy confusion of multifaceted issues such as this one, it becomes a lot more difficult to hold to such principles than it seems. For example, it turns out you can't just label them as "racists" and assume that scores some sort of point. In the end, it is important to defend everybody's right to publish such cartoons without fear of reprisal - that their motivations in doing so are disagreeable to you is irrelevant.

Besides, isn't it obvious that the vast majority of the enraged Muslims don't give a hoot about the history of Jyllands-Posten?
It would seem that a hierarchy of tags would be best.  So if, say, arc 1.0 was released tomorrow, it should be here, and in graham, and in lisp.

That's what I thought, it seems unlikely that the kid is real. But even if they do have a kid they are still being total pieces of sh!t for giving their kid a valuable item that they found. They should have just returned it. So they are either making up some awful lie to ease their guilt/wiggle out of what could have been a nasty confrontation, or simply being horrible parents.
Maybe my post was a bit unclear; I don’t say that JP did not have the right to publish the cartoons. Of course they have the right to publish them and do so without any fear of reprisal. And of course the Muslims reaction is totally of proportion. But I can still believe this and think that JP was wrong in publishing the cartoons. You say that the motivation for publishing is irrelevant, I disagree. I think that the motivation for the initial publishing is indeed interesting. It is to simplify the story to make it just about free speech and religious submission.

"absolutely contradicts"? Not as far as I can tell. This here is a philosophical conception of time, not a predictive one. And, for that matter, it doesn't seem all that inconsistent with the "block" concept of time inspired by field theory.
(Yes, it's not Lorentz invariant and it doesn't take causal structures into account. But for a single observer at low speed, who cares?)
badbadbad.   If you are going to do this, just go to tags instead of up/down
*"[The spirit of political parties] serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion."*

*IRV is pretty much the only well-known voting system that fails the monotonicity criterion: it is possible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher, and to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking him lower.*

I understand how a similar situation can arise: For example, if you prefer candidate A to candidate B to candidate C, it's possible that if you list them as A first, B second, and C last, you will cause C to win, whereas B would have won had you listed him them B-A-C instead of A-B-C.

However, I don't see how what you said - cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking *him* higher - is possible.  Could you please give an example?
No. Recent studies have found the opposite to be true, but it was a common opinion in the late 1800s to mid 1900s when routine circumcision became popular.
When posting comments, I mean.

Almost every time that I've edited one of my comments, it's because I &lt;i&gt;did this&lt;/i&gt; instead of *doing this*.
I agree that condorcet and approval voting both seem better than Instant Runoff, which is in turn better than majority rules. However, for some reason political activist groups have gotten behind IRV and not the others. Is it only because it's easier to understand?
I'm sure smaller parties would eventually get hit with their share of disapproval votes. I, for example would vote against any candidate associted with the National Socialist White People's Party (American Nazi Party) or Constitution Party (conservative Christian).

I think the net effect would be to encourage very mild government, and I think most of the time less government is better.

What are people modding down for?
Just about anything is better than first-past-the-post. IRV is not much better. It is totally unfriendly to smaller parties. One method I like is the Borda count. Voters rank candidates by order of preference. The first choice get 3 points, say, the second choice 2 points and the third choice 1 point. Then the points for all the candidates are added up, and the one with the largest number of points wins. It's simple, and very fair.

I think I remember seeing a writeup about this by the author of the patent in an old issue of the Whole Earth Review. As I recall, his intention was to prevent this process from being used until there was sufficient public discourse about it. It would also be interesting to see who would attempt to challenge this patent.
Better, you could check to see what language the browser accept, and send that. W3 uses it for their CSS validator. Set your system language to Japanese, and the page comes up in Japanese.

A tendency toward deadlock is a feature, not a bug; a government that tends not to act in response to controversial issues rather than do something rash is usually better in the long run.
I'm not sure failing monotonicity is that big a deal. Voting systems are 'good' if they produce 'fair' outcomes for a particular set of votes. Though counter-intuitive the circumstances that cause IRV to fail monotonicity are rare and involve close elections anyway. The biggest problem with Condorcet to my mind, is its biggest feature, that is selecting compromise candidates. Often the least objectionable candidate simply wasn't scrutinized closely enough.
I think this would be a good start. Eventually, I'd like to see reddit-style [bidirectional approval voting](http://reddit.com/info?id=222l) used for elections. I'm not especially optimistic about either one ever being put in to use in the US though; the major parties aren't likely to support it.

Labelling Jyllands Posten, or Denmark as a whole as 'racist' is not only generalising - it's also ignorant. But never the less, a perfect example of the image that some people would like to stamp upon us. Making up this huge conflict between 'muslims' and 'christians' in Denmark, which in essence exists only in the media. Jyllands Posten may be a right-wing newspaper, but if you had bothered reading this letter, or even the original article with which these cartoons were originally printed, OR look up the cases that sparked it, you would, with a bit of luck - given your attitude, get that this isn't to do with anything 'racist' (racist?? seriously, look up the definition for that word.) - but has a perfectly legal point to it. But I guess it's so much easier to point your finger and pout. So much for understanding and dialogue... :-"

No - the statement of the problem says "Monty then counters by...showing you what is behind one of the other doors".  There is no mention that he has the option to not offer a switch,  ie. in this problem (though not the actual gameshow on which the problem is based) he will _always_ show another door.  If this is the case, his intention is irrelevant, since he will not show the grand prize.
How? Subdirs maybe? http://www.reddit.com/lisp? http://www.reddit.com/any_tag? Or http://www.reddit.com?topic_group=anytag? Maybe workable.
Yes: it's a complaint you often hear about proofs that rely on lots of computer-checking, notably the [four-colour theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Four-ColorTheorem.html). It's interesting that the article also mentions the classification of the finite simple groups as a "claimed proof". I've always heard that referred to as a) a definite proof and b) one of the triumphs of modern mathematics.

Actually, this article seems to be entirely derived from the complaints of this Thomas Hales (and his friend) about the slow verification process for their proposed proof of the Kepler problem! Frankly I don't see why they're surprised, having submitted such an unpleasantly brutal proof in the first place...

"worst part of current voting [is] that you have to buy an all-in-one package of opinions" That's supposing that (a) the voters are smart enough to build a consistent system of thoughs for themselves and (b) many voters, with many individually consistent political views, will, when melted carelessly by any voting system, let emerge a consistent political line, that would be somehow representative of them.

(a) is part of democraties' dogma, but like many religious dogmae, facts tend to prove it wrong. (Notice that "being wrong" is not incompatible with "being something the layman should believe"). 

(b) seems grossly wrong to me. So does it for IRV proponents as well, it seems, since they insist on having one person/party getting absolute majority of seats.

Now, I'm not pretending that political parties address this issue adequately, even less than a US-style bipartisan system does. But I strongly doubt that a partyless system would do better.

Don't forget: the main feature of democracy is not that it chooses the best candidate; it quite obviously doesn't. Its main purpose is that it ensures that grossly abusive rulers will get fired. Which is of course extremely valuable, although it sometimes takes too much times...

Insufficiently justified; what about large projects?
Sounds like a classic case of "sh!t rolls downhill".  Some higher up probably gave this manager his marching orders.  Until one of these higher ups quits over-promising it will always be like this, especially since developers have nobody below them they can blame.  Can you imagine the kind of loyalty a manager with backbone would command?  And in this job market which is just as good for managers as developers, they don't need to fear their superiors: they can find another job as quickly as a good developer can.

So this is what a developer really needs: a manager with backbone, who also has a spouse with a good job ;)

People want to play the new games and watch porn, not fiddle around adding nonfree repositories to their package manager's sources list so they can download the codecs required to watch movies.  I'm a Linux user, but only because the benefits (none of which would be apparent to a user who doesn't use their machine primarily for data mining/writing programs - i.e. 99% of computer users) outweigh the annoyances.

Changing the desktop background and making the task bar look different (which is what booting into Knoppix means to the average Windows user) isn't going to convince anybody of anything.
Amusingly, this is the basis for the CheapAss game "US Patent Number 1".  The goal of the game is to get back to the patent office on the very first day, so you can get the first patent for your own machine.  The other players (also time travelers) will try to stop you.  Hilarious, as usual for CheapAss Games.

The group of people that is only interested in the olympics or only interested in politics?  I doubt that these groups really exist.  I like reddit exactly because it makes me stumble across stuff I would never have looked for.  Exactly because it serves my manifold interests.
This could be a solution.  But isn't it reddits simplicity and straight-forwardness what makes its appeal?  It's a common phenomenon (especially in the open source world) that people always try to improve things and completely miss the point when something is perfect.  Many nice projects fail because people can't stop adding 'improvements' until the project is ruined altogether.  And: it's always much easier to bloat something than to de-bloat it afterwards!

A working 'recommended' feature would make most of the subreddits unnecessary (except the meta-reddits).  If I'm not interested in politics the filter will learn that.  There are some quite nice implementations of such filters on the web and it's no secret how to do such things.  Indeed the problem seems to be a relative of the spam-filtering problem which has been very well studied.
I just found that some of the original work on AOP was done on lisp:

I can't help thinking that something has been lost since. Well, not lost in the sense that it's something we've forgotten how to do. Lost in the sense that we've emphasized the wrong parts, and what was genuinely important about AOP lies lost in the confusion.

That whole thing about teenage sex always falls apart when people realize that college freshmen are teenagers, and sex+alcohol is pretty much their whole lives :-P
we need a good term for it. Redditdot just doesn't sound right, and no one would get reddited.
i suspect it's because IRV is easier to understand; it may be perceived as the most politically acceptable alternative to first-past-the-post here in the USA. i agree that there are theoretically better ones, and personally i'd actually like to see single-winner voting deprecated in favour of a multi-party parliamentary system, but i *know* i won't get *that* in my lifetime. IRV, for all its flaws, might perhaps see some minor use in the U.S. sometime reasonably soon.
It's not really clear from the article.  The other main example they cite, which is the theorem about the classification of finite simple groups, was *not* done by computer.  It's a huge theorem, involving many special cases, proved by many people over about a hundred years. But so far as I know there were no computers involved anywhere. 

The theorem is very big, and so hard to verify in that sense, but it's hardly a typical example, and I don't think I would have pointed to it as a demonstration that "mathematical proofs are getting harder to verify".  It's not at all clear that this theorem is part of a trend, insofar is it's unique.

I think "Ancient People" prefer the term "Senior Citizens" these days.
It's not so much about whether you want or don't want Linux, it's about having the choice at all.

Let's take this submission as an example -- pretend we could edit links as suggested by earthboundkid. We'd be relying on ddarko to come back here and notice his typo. How often do you think the average user rereads all their old submissions? Not often.

Some portion of the population is really good at proofreading -- call them G. Another portion is really bad. 
Call them B.

* Who's mostly likely to make errors in their submissions? B.

* Who's most likely to notice the problems and want to change them? G.

* Who's least likely to notice the errors? B.

* Who's the only one who can fix them? B. 

Therefore, i think it's necessary to set things up so that we don't have to rely on the original poster to come back, notice their error, and fix it. Instead, it should be possible for the community to do it through democracy:

1. Someone (either the original submitter or anyone else) submits a proposed alternate title
2. Users vote on which is better
3. The one with the most votes gets listed

I don't think this is much better than the current situation -- the kind of people who submit bad titles (be it due to typos, poor choice of words, hyperbole, or misrepresentation) are the least likely to realize that the titles are bad.

And if the karma went back to zero, that would be additional disincentive to edit a title. Why not just delete the story and resubmit it?

Instead, see my earlier suggestion, which i think is a lot more likely to result in better titles.

Seriously, the "if you don't like it, quit and leave, because the market's great" attitude is really short term thinking. The market won't always be great, and there will always be asshat managers out there that think that the stick will get higher productivity than the carrot.

The manager mentioned needs to be educated or step aside. And considering that most of the developers probably have family, friends, kids, and might not want to quit and uproot, they should try reasoning with him. Getting fired for the business-correct way of saying "This will happen when monkeys fly out of my ass" isn't that much worse than "They said some mean things about timeline and risk. I didn't like it, so I quit."

And if you do end up leaving, the market is good right now, so you're lucky.

What it misses when it accuses the danish paper of waving the red flag for 4 months "until finally succeeded in finding a couple of zealots who got themselves worked up in the desired way." is that the massive reaction in the muslim world is due to a further three cartoons which have nothing to do with the danish paper, and are much more offensive.

It's not devious, it's called market segmentation, and it makes perfect sense with information goods. Why should everyone pay the same share of the development cost of a product if they get different monetary levels of utility from it? Unfortunately, because people are resistent to the idea of paying different amounts for the same product, and because resale tends to undercut such strategies, you have to offer versions with varying features rather than the same version at different prices.

I don't get it. How can you find the metadata?
Another skeptic complaining about the difficulty of predicting markets and using it to suggest that it's folly to listen to economists, fund managers, etc. That's like saying that since the weather is a complex and unpredictable phenomenon, one shouldn't listen to weather forecasts.
I personally don't beleive in anything the writer of this book claims (that the Holocaust didn't happen, etc), but he's getting 10 years for writing it?!

How many right-wing pundits will cry out on their talk shows to print segments of his book in order to defend the priniciples of Free Speech? I'm guessing none...


Some things to look at and think about
Ok, my bad.  I didn't really research it, but I know Japanese uses Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana (please forgive me if I misspelled these) to write, whereas Chinese uses only Kanji.  Since the page has a combination of Kanji and Hiragana, I assumed it was Japanese.
There are only five editions. The crippled version without Aero isn't even branded with the Vista name, and the EU-mandated neutered versions don't count, either.

I think Vista is generally a good thing underneath, but the new start menu design (ugly round button) is a major step backward. When the menu opens, there's an icon at the top that sits halfway off the edge and a couple of redundant borders on the white half of the menu. I know they can produce better designs because their older stuff wasn't so bad.
For example, when i read through the New section, there's a lot of crap. So i set my score filter to 3. But then later, i'm reading through the features.reddit.com submissions, and i want to see all of them.

Seems like this would be more useful at the local/state level than the federal level. I'd guess that if even under approval voting the Dems/Republicans would still split the federal races, without any 3rd party candidates getting enough votes to win seats. Perhaps at the local/state level there is less voting strictly along party lines.

That said, I'm all for considering anything that would improve the electoral situation in the U.S. I'd be happy to start with Congressional districts that are drawn up by independent  panels aimed at improving competiveness, like in Iowa. Having the winners decide the rules seems like it will ensure more elections like 2004, where 98% of the incumbents in the House were re-elected.

Here's a fun experiment you can do with little effort:  Track the weather forecast for two weeks (or two months or years, depending on your patience).  You will be able to see how far ahead the weather is accurately forecast (in my area it's about four days if they are predicting clear weather, much shorter if they predict rain).  It is folly to listen to specific weather forecasts for a month from now.

Taleb's argument is more subtle. He thinks that it's human nature to overestimate the predictability of the market. And in consequence, to underestimate the chance of extreme events. In fact, he argues that fund managers are likely to do *worse* than random since they overestimate their own knowledge.

He has a unique strategy for his firm, Empirica Capital. He accepts small losses every year in exchange for being able to reap huge rewards in case of a very extreme event. I'd like to see how well this strategy is doing, but I can't find any figures on how the firm does.
Interesting, PHP sends out a 302 (http://php.net/header),
but according to the article this ought to have been a 303.

From the article:

  It is interesting that PRG pattern exploits non-standard 
  behavior of browsers and web servers. HTTP 1.1 defines 
  several redirect response codes in 3xx range. Some of 
  these codes require browser to use the same request type, 
  some require to change POST to GET, some require to obtain
  user confirmation when request is redirected. Turns out 
  that many of these requirements are not implemented by 
  popular browsers. Instead, they have common de-facto 
  behavior, like redirecting POST to GET without 
  confirmation if received 302 code. This feature is used by
  PRG pattern.


  This behavior is wrong for 302 ("Found") code, but is 
  absolutely correct for 303 ("See Other") code. Still, few 
  servers return 303 when redirect with GET method is 
  required. HttpResponse.sendRedirect method does not allow 
  to set response code, it always returns 302. It is 
  possible to emulate sendRedirect(url) behavior using the 
  following methods:
 

    res.setStatus(res.SC_SEE_OTHER);
    res.setHeader("Location",url);

  where SC_SEE_OTHER is the proper 303 code, but 
  sendRedirect provides some additional service like 
  resolving relative addresses, so this is not a direct 
  snap-in. The discrepancy between browser behavior and HTTP
   standard can be resolved, if 302 and 303 codes considered
   equal, and another code for proper 302 behavior were 
  created.


  In any case, I doubt that browser vendors will change 
  implementation of 302 response code, because too many 
  applications relay on it. The good thing is that modern 
  browsers understand and correctly process 303 code, so if 
  you want to be sure, return 303 instead of 302.

You better believe i keep a close eye on my investments, and i compare current and long-term performance against the big indexes. Mutual funds exist for a reason, and that reason is not that everyone in the world is stupid.

Take a look at universities, and how they manage their breathtaking endowments. They don't just dump it all in an index fund. They have professionals manage their money. Again, it's not because the world's leading universities are stupid.

As for the government's forecasters, i haven't paid that much attention to their accuracy because it doesn't affect any decisions i make; i'm only indirectly affected by what they predict.

I'm not saying they're oracles or psychics. I'm just saying that it's worth listening to experts, while maintaining a healthy skepticism.

Why downmod this? See comments at http://request.reddit.com/goto?id=221a
Religion is a type of unreason, but it is certainly not the only one.

It seems redundant to this, but there are many who don't know it: Reason is man's *only* means of obtaining knowledge.

Communism *could not* end up successfully. Even if somehow leaders that were not mass murderers came to be in control, many would die from starvation, poor medical care (or none at all), or would die early even if they survived. And that's with the ideal "pure" Communism proposed by Marx and his lot. The more you deviate from the supposed "ideal" of Communism, the more you can postpone the failure of the whole damn thing, which is another way of saying that it's completely wrong.
I hadn't thought of that angle. That might actually be another use for it.

Hi, I'm Eli Gottlieb's Head!
To be fair, I think this is a Hard Problem. People's likes and dislikes are really not homogeneous.
Your slightly off with that comparison. By insisting previously that the gas chambers used for executing countless Jews did not exist he BROKE THE LAW. That's not the same as legally publishing images that could court controvesy. The difference isn't purely the semantics of what he said, but the legality of his actions.
Contrary to everyone else, I support jailing this man.  I also support free speech, though.

If a man yells "fire" in a theater, it is not free speech.  If  a person slanders another person, it is not free speech.  If a man gives false information while under an oath of truth, it is not free speech.

What these set a standard for is that damaging or insulting speech made as a *statement of fact* is not free speech.  This man, therefore, has no right to say something both hateful and false about a historical event everyone (except neo-Nazis) knows happened.  There are videos of testimony given by Holocaust survivors, for God's sake!
The title is fine except for the spelling of 'eerie' :) Nice picture though.
Yes, there are still [significant](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/464260.stm) elements in Austria who misrepresent the Holocaust. Small, but significant.
why is this being modded down? are there terrorist sympathizers on this site? a significant fraction of the hamas legislators are currently _in jail_.

Then he suggests this shouldn't hurt the peace process and Palestine shouldn't be punished for who they select as a leader. After all - was anyone really thinking that they would live up to ANY of their side of the peace agreements?

At least this time around Palestine will have a govt that doesn't talk peace but do murder. These guys are letting us know up front they wanna kill as many Jews as they possibly can. Nice to know where they stand for a change.

News organizations often distribute "facts" which are demonstably false and damaging. A man named Richard Jewell had his life ruined when he was accused falsely (by the media, not the police) of the Olympics bombing in 1996. Should the newspeople go to jail? How about the bastards who stand on my street with a megaphone claiming as "fact" that I am a subhuman deviant and that I am going to Hell?

There are no abstract principles at work here. 'Damaging' and 'insulting' cannot be quantified. The Holocaust is violently touchy subject in Europe and will be for a long time. I can understand the feelings behind, but not agree with, these kinds of laws.
OK, no.reddit.com is on the way! (the alien is busy learning *both* forms of norwegian).
27, let us note, puts them at almost exactly 10% of the way to what they'd need to impeach. At this point there is a Republican majority in the House; that could change by January, but probably not to the extent that a majority would be willing to impeach the president. Even if it were, Republicans have a majority in the Senate as well. The odds that they would fall below the 35 needed to prevent conviction after impeachment are derisory.

Is it true? Sure. Does it make a difference? Probably not.

It's along the lines of not being able to shout 'fire' in a crowded theatre, but its way down that line.

Does his speech incite a riot? Does it cause a "clear and present danger?" These questions lead to our "time, place and manner" restrictions. In the US regulation needs to be content neutral and narrowly tailored. This whole paragraph is full of oftenquoted words when discussing freedom of speech, and they all spawn from the 'fire' example.

I do not think it is fair to say that the 'fire' quote excuses these kind of limitations on freedom of speech. I do understand that the Holocaust is a very touchy subject in Europe, and when I visited a concentration camp I was myself overwhelmed with feeling. The quote on one of the monuments that was translated for me said something to the effect "we must never forget, and each generation must work to remember so that such attrocities can never happen again."

In my opinion, the only way people are going to forget is if they can't talk or argue about it.
The media is not over reacting they are simply becoming more aware of this problem that DESTROYS lives.  I know how much of a problem this is because I have been there- seen it, felt it, tasted it, HATE it.

This page was probably derived from the original "MIT" document, but has better diagrams:

Similar to the other site posted, but with better diagrams.
&gt; You are not supporting free speech when you say that the man has no right to say something hateful and false, because for all you know he might have unearthed some evidence that the holocaust didnt happen. Now as extremely unlikely as that may be, he should still be allowed to express himself, and we should all be allowed to express ourselves back.

Firstly, the fact that the holocaust happened is indisputable. But if you want to discuss the wider principle of free speech, you need to consider that Irving was not convicted for saying something that people disagree with, but because he broke a well-known specific law which carries a sentence of up to 10 years - there's a fundamental difference there. Presumably you don't think that the Austrians should let people get away with breaking their laws?

Not in the opinion of the Austrians - they support this law. (And I can see their point as Irving has been widely used as a source of persuasion by neo-nazis).

It seems to me if you went forward in time and the patent wasn't there, you could file it in the future.  Likewise, if you went back in the past and it wasn't there, you could file it at that time.  Whatever time you happen to be in, you could file the patent, as long as there was a patent office there in which to file it.  Of course, if you went back in time and filed the patent, you would change the future, and then couldn't get back to the "original" spot in time you were in.
Deleting in protest of Reddit's new anti-user admin policies.
&gt;He believes in the government's ability to "forecast" economic variables, oil prices, GNP growth, or inflation... but our historical track record in predicting is pitiful. It does not take long to verify these claims; simple empiricism would suffice. Yet we have confident forecasts of social security deficits by both sides 

So when the government forsees a problem (eg inflation) and adjusts policy accordingly (eg interest rates), Nassim Taleb
 claims that if the problem no longer turns out as feared, it's empirical evidence the economist's track record is pitiful. At least I think that's what he's claiming - I'm not aware of any countries that conduct controlled empirical tests with their economies.

He perhaps needs a lesson in "simple empiricism".

I agree with the underlying point of his article though.

No - he's comparing Hamas to Hitler. You are the one who brought up Mandela (who *was* a marxist and whose wife did kidnap and torture people but that's a side issue and doesn't bring him to the level of Hitler or Hamas).

Meanwhile, ALL of Hamas' leaders have either called for or actually participated in the murder of innocent women and children and are looking for the opportunity to do it again.

The man stated as a fact that the Holocaust never happened.  This is against all evidence and against plain fact.  The Holocaust happened.  Second of all, find me a Holocaust denier who isn't hoping for a second Holocaust.  Right there is the motivation and the reason behind this law.

There will be no second Holocaust; that kind of hatred for anyone will not be allowed again.  Period.  If someone wants to be a Nazi then I want them locked up, where "Nazi" is defined as holding and supporting the views of the Nazi Party that took/held power in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s.

&gt;This prohibition is a limitation along the lines of not being able to say 'fire' in a theatre.

No, it isn't. Yelling 'fire' in a theater induces everyone therein to evacuate the building, which creates a dangerous situation and costs the theater owner money. The act of yelling 'fire' is not intended to communicate an opinion, but to cause a group of people to immediately take a specific action. The act is therefore considered an action, not speech.

Denying the holocaust is expressing an opinion. It does not directly cause other people to act; it's speech. It's easy to support free speech when people are saying things you find agreeable or non-offensive; the real test is when someone says something that is both false and offensive. I support free speech, which includes holocaust denial and other forms of racist nonsense.
So how long before the N.I.C.E. starts taking over?

What you just proposed actually sounds a lot like MS's .NET approach.
The author quotes Eddington recounting an old argument that if the velocity of gravity were merely &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, gravitational orbits would be unstable.  I found this interesting, so on the way home I stopped at the library and fetched the book he quotes from.  The &lt;i&gt;very next sentence&lt;/i&gt; in the book is "The argument is fallacious, because the effect of propagation will not necessarily be that S is attracted in the direection towards J'."

That the web page author fails to include this sentence suggests willful deception, and screams "crank" to me.
It wasn't an insinuation - it was an extension of your logic to reveal the absurdity of your position. If you think it is dumb to say that the holocaust is indisputable, you are saying that it is therefore a function of intelligence to question the holocaust. The comment about the North Pole was addressing your geocentric universe - it was an example of a situation where applying the scientific method is grossly inappropriate (perhaps even dogmatic).
Of course yelling fire is just one of the many forms of speech which are prohibited for good reason. I used it as an example  because it is clear (and because holocaust denial is obviously inflammatory - more like lighting a fire in certain situations). As it is an analogy, it obviously might not hold up to certain kinds of ultra-literal comparison (holocaust denial is in its own class after all). 

&gt; I support free speech, which includes holocaust denial and other forms of racist nonsense.

Every society has some limitations on freedom of speech, ranging from child porn to slander to NDA's - this is about protection of rights not suppression.
First, Irving is despicable and his theories are rubbish. Michael Shermer (of the Skeptic Magazine) has written some very succient rebuttals of Irving (as well as has taken a look at their mindset):
http://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Michael+Shermer%22+%2B%22David+Irving%22

Lastly, this is pathetic. First, freedom of speech is *exactly* for offensive speech: mocking religion, printing pornography, blowing whistles and yes, saying plainly disgusting things (such as denying the Holocaust); this is simply so as bland, inoffensive speech needs no defense.

Strategically, this is a bad move: this will a) give Irving a great audience to preach to (all the prisoners he will be exposed to) b) give him martyr status c) set of a slippery slope for more prohibitions on free speech (and with the timing coinciding with the Muhammed cartoons, you can more than bet that this will also mean creating laws against insulting Islam -- effectively implementing parts of Sharia in the West).

I really, really, *really* hate websites that decide that they know what size my browser window should be better than I do.

Hmmm. With the success the politics of fear has had over the last couple years here(*cough*Dick Cheney*cough*), there should be a growing market for off-the-wall shit like this. If you can sell a war on fear, there should be a good chunk of people whose disposal income you can liberate with it.
Google's secrets
I wasn't so thrilled with the article. I think may people are skeptical about the stockmarket (look at those nice Merril Lynch convictions), CEOs, the media (look at Fox!), and economists' ability to predict. I certainly am.

Of course, at some point you have to make decisions and get on with your life, so you can't question everything.

For economics, I think that the weather is a good analogy. Exactness is difficult, and only remotely possible for the short term. Climate (i.e. it will be warm in summer, and rain more in April) is easier, and I think that's what more policy decisions are based on. Of course, almost everyone also has their own agenda, which needs to be factored in. For example, governments almost always predict more growth than independent economists (unless they want to justify cutting something).

In any case, I still find a lack of religious skepticism more dangerous, because religion (some forms, yadda yadda) represents an entire mode of thought -- faith over rationality and empiricism. And that can have deadly consequences in all manner of endeavors.

you're missing the point. It's dumb to say anything is indisputable. As a counter-example to your claim that the holocaust is indisputable: in 1989 David Irving disputed it. In my belief he was factually incorrect in disputing it, as there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that supports a belief in the holocaust. But he still disputed it.

pretty cool guide
Funnily enough, when he sued someone for libel (and lost) in 2000 there was little evidence that he had recanted his views.

My own opinion - he's a nasty evil shitty little man who deserves to be in prison just for being himself.  And he did break the law in Austria.  Whether there should be laws in Austria banning Holocaust denial is a moot point.  Note that lots of countries have laws along similar lines - Germany, France etc.  This was only 60 years ago...
I must say, I never thought I'd be so fascinated by an article on detergents.
Perhaps you should read the article. Carter points out that although winning a parliamentary majority, Hamas actually lack an _effective_ majority due to some of their representatives being in prison, and details other constitutional arrangements that would limit their effective power. This is mainly due to the position of president Abbas, who has said that he will not appoint a prime minister that does not accept the legitimacy of Israel and the roadmap.

I don't think Carter was pleased with Hamas' success. Rather, he's accepting the situation as having occured and suggesting what appears to be a very intelligent approach to dealing with it. The alternative is to stick your head in the sand, bury the peace process, and have an automatic escalation in violence.

I don't think you should have to own a trademark to get a domain. I'm saying that if someone already owns the trademark, registrars shouldn't sell the domain to someone else. In fact, the law for .coms is already that you can have arbitration to get  a domain from someone else if you already had the trademark, and they're in violation of it. However, it'd be nice if registrars would do the due diligence of checking that upfront. I mean, what exactly are we paying them for?

Which Modesitt series?  I've read a couple of his fantasy series, but I don't recall this theme at all.
I agree - the title was automatically taken by reddit from the site's title. However, this should be useful for folks in the testing/QA profession.
&gt; the acid test being whether there is a consensus

Lots of folks put forth this argument that if the 'majority' agrees then it is OK yet the US Constitution posits that there are some rights (individual rights) that aren't subject to the whims of the majority--at least not without the extra burden of a constitutional amendment.
Okay, I can sorta understand the outrage at the fact that one company, and an unpopular one at that, would control all .com registrations.

However, I disagree that the prices should follow the more general Internet
trend of decreasing. While the Internet's infrastructure is increasing in both
bandwidth and capacity, the amount of .com domains available for purchase
is quickly shrinking. In other words, the supply for .com domains is decreasing while the demand is increasing.

Speaking strictly economically, the vendors should increase their prices. The fact that they haven't has lead to unofficial vendors who resell domains for higher prices (namely domain squatters).

Like it or not, domain squatters exist because of the current fixed, low-price domain model that is in place today. I don't have a solution for you, but arguing for continued low prices certainly isn't one.

I think this article is well intensioned and all, but I don't think it's very well thought out (although the author seems to admit this anyway.)

The type of content produced under this business model would be extremely high spec, and so therefore ensuring that our hardware companies then sell more high spec hardware, right? Which means every new film coming out this year would require Intel's or Apple's latest "innovative" new media hardware. Which would effectively prevent you from playing that new media on last year's hardware. Which is, in effect a kind of DRM, where people aren't restricted by sophisticated encryption software, but by having last year's obsolete hardware gadgets.

But it doesn't stop there, Apple would (hypothetically) then put in measures to stop Apple content from being played on Intel hardware, and viz-a-viz. Which brings us back to DRM - only now, our content is under the control of a much bigger (15 times bigger), and much more powerfull industry - who doesn't really care about _art_ so much as _hardware_.

And then Intel would invent Skynet to manage all that new DRM, and we'd all be toast. THIS IS A WARNING!
"There is no scientific evidence for it [Darwin's Origin of Species]. It's only a theory. Man is the wonder of God's creation."
So she is saying Darwin's Origin of Species is a theory, therefore the Bible/Qur'an/Whatever must be true. I'm not convinced. 
The Origin of Species is a theory, which is why it is more credible that the bible, which simply states God created us.

Many countries in Europe legaly ban nazi speech and symbols  - at least France and Germany do. France especially is known to take legal actions against internet companies including Ebay, Amazon, Yahoo and Google in order to enforce these laws (preventing the access of French users to the *Mein Kampf* book or auctions with nazi items, banning sites from the search index). To me this is no different from the Chinese internet censorship, but most people are not really *that* sensitive to freedom of speech issues when it doesn't concern their own views. 

Some old articles about nazi-related censorship in the internet:
http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/1488031
http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,39020381,2082688,00.htm

There are "things you can't say" in the Western culture, it is just silly to deny that and claim freedom of speech is absolute for us.
Believe me, I can understand the feeling behind all this. The danger comes from the absoluteness of it. You aim to get rid of "that kind of hatred for anyone", but it's being done through ham-fisted laws... which is the first step to state-sponsored hatred. 

I accept that Austria &amp; other countries which actively participated probably should have these laws as proof of repentance... but I worry when something is so absolute.

But let me suggest a different way to reduce hatred: think of a person you hate. Ask yourself, honestly, what can I learn from this person? Make the effort to do so. You may end up still *despising* him, but blind hatred is harder.

Once at a party there was a man who started confiding in me his belief that 'they' were taking over by breeding faster than 'us', and mixing 'breeds'. His mistake was I am one of 'them' and am quite proud of being 'mixed'. I threw him out of my house. Much later I realized my mistake. I had indulged in blind hate. I still would throw him out, but I should have made the effort to understand where he got such stupid ideas, and maybe tried to show him different.
Just guess what the hardware companies do to get the "runs best with nvidia" and similar logos to appear on the games...
I agree with you, real child porn doesn't apply here, though photoshopped child porn does not involve the abuse of children and is also illegal. Each of these limitations are in their own class - the point being that freedom of speech can not be applied in a formulaic way and there are widely recognised exceptions.

And yet the US also has prohibitions on certain forms of free speech. I'd say the fact that the US courts haven't yet recognised it as a form of defamation is more an indication of a shortcoming of the US legal system rather than an example of how the rest of the world should behave.
The point is, the fact that Hamas does not have anything near complete control means that to have _any_ power they will have to make compromises with more moderate people - in a coalition in the parliament and also with Abbas. Carter sees as an opportunity for Hamas to become more moderate themselves. Which is a good thing, just look at the improvements in Northern Ireland with regard to the moderation of Sinn Fein/IRA.

All of the examples are socially accepted limitations on freedom of speech - but I would have thought it beyond obvious that they all have their own character so you clearly cannot make some kind of literal-minded 1:1 comparison of their qualities without any point of divergence.

Everyone's citing Google's particular formula as if its the one true way to form an internet company is **starting to drive me up a wall**.

Lets take a look at some of their basic design principals:

&gt; Pages load instantly.

Well these are nice, but these are simply goals to aim for instead of requirements for success. I can think of many sites that went through severe growing pains while continuing to increase their userbase 10x.

&gt; Placement in search results is never sold to anyone.

Well thats ok, at least we can argree that *AOL is no one;)*

&gt; It's best to do one thing really, really well.

This is great advice about 80% of the time.. But in general it has been proven to be wrong. Some of the best sites are successful because they combine common services together in  an effective way. For example- the new networking sites, [ms](http://myspace.com), [fb](http://facebook.com), etc; craigs list; for god's sake google itself now combines mail, chat, search, newsgroups and more in a very profitable way.


then under:

&gt; You can make money without doing evil.

It just talks about targeted advertising! Non relavent advertisements are all that is evil? Give me a break.

To cover themselves, though, they finally admit that their formula itself isn't all that useful. I've quoted it all below:

&gt; Full-disclosure update: When we first wrote these "10 things" four years ago, we included the phrase "Google does not do horoscopes, financial advice or chat." Over time we've expanded our view of the range of services we can offer –- web search, for instance, isn't the only way for people to access or use information -– and products that then seemed unlikely are now key aspects of our portfolio. This doesn't mean we've changed our core mission; just that the farther we travel toward achieving it, the more those blurry objects on the horizon come into sharper focus (to be replaced, of course, by more blurry objects).

Now I'm not trying to tear apart every piece of their cute little *values list*, but is anyone does anyone else see this as nothing more than a marketing tool?
Are they providing translations or definitions?
"Computer science, by contrast, is a new way of thinking, a new way of looking at things. For example, mathematics can't come near to describing the complexity of human endeavors in the way that computer science can. To make a literary analogy, mathematics produces the equivalent of one-liners – equations that are pithy, insightful, brilliant. Computer science is more like a novel by Tolstoy: it is messy and infuriatingly complex."

Then I stopped reading.

Well obviously you _can_ do anything that isn't prohibited by the laws of physics or an empty wallet etc. One meaning of the word indisputable is 'beyond doubt' and I would say this applies to the holocaust given the evidence we have. It would certainly meet a historian's burden of proof. If you say that it's dumb to say anything is indisputable, you are also saying that it's intelligent to question everything with no differentiation.

VeriSign does not have a monopoly. They have plenty of competition. If people think VeriSign's prices are too high, they can simply purchase (or switch to) a .net, a .biz, a .info, or a .whatever. Sure, these aren't as 'lucrative' as .com domains, but if VeriSign makes its prices exorbitant, people will start purchasing them anyway and VeriSign will be forced to lower its prices if it wants to continue making money.

As an evolutionary biology student, I've been wondering at what point I'll be thrown out of the US for denying creationism...but I always thought I'd be safe in Europe.  At least in America, most college students believe in evolution (from what I can tell), and the creationists are crazy guys trying to find a way to get religion into the government (Google: The Wedge).  This story implies that, in the UK, it's the college students who are leading the charge.  Scary.

There were many other examples given and the point was made that they are all quite distinctive. The argument was that there are socially accepted limitations to freedom of speech around the world, not that holocaust denial is strictly analogous to anything else.
the idea that what you work on is a fundamental truth and what everyone else does is a conceited useless idea that nearly everyone has. realizing that what everyone does is one step towards awesomeness. realizing that there is no truth is the next step. go read richard rorty, and find out.
dear BioGeek:

allowing reddit or the author to choose your titles for you is stupid. it makes you an obvious bot. and makes a lot of your shit get voted way down, when it might be good. but most people never know because your titles suck ass.
"If you are right, then why aren't students clamoring to major in computer science?"

As a recent computer engineering/cs grad, my immediate response was "outsourcing", and I know my fellow classmates would likely agree.  Later, the author is on the money and acknowledges my fear: "And aren't all the programming jobs being shipped overseas?".  However, NEVER again in the article does he come back to that concern.

Quite frankly, the author not addressing outsourcing is a case in point; there is no fix for what should be a booming field if no one will hire you.

Excellent points, very well made. I loved this bit: "We like the idea of infinity. A problem with infinity in it is easily solved. How long can you pollute a planet infinitely large? Easy: forever. Stop thinking."

As a story, though, it felt a bit too melodramatic, what with "the worst psychic trauma the race has yet suffered", and the female protagonist's tough exterior/hidden pain cliche. Or maybe there's something too lethargic about two people in a room just talking for the whole of the story. :-)
"The Holocaust (capitalised) is reserved for the Jewish holocaust."

so by definition there can be no second holocaust. I took him to mean no second holocaust like event, as otherwise it's just a tautology.

BTW, there's one mistake in the article.  YC doesn't get about 6% per founder, but about 6% *total*. Otherwise it's pretty accurate.
They need to make clear to lesson planners that creationism and evolution are not on equal footing. One is a *religious belief* based on the words of profets hundreds of years ago while the other is a *scientific deduction* based on facts. By even mentioning creationism in classrooms, as one person in the article said they did, you are giving students the wrong impression.

When this actually comes out, it looks like it'll be a useful tool.
What's that? Reddit's is making its way into the PR business? ;) Well we'll
let it slide this time.

I think that this is a great way for allowing the general public, those that
don't have connections in tech startups, to get a foot in. The only
similar event I can think of was [google's](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html). Surely there have
been others(?) The advantage of y-combinator's event over Google's is
that people get to start their own projects instead of being forced to work on
someone else's. This allows for much more motivational return for those
involved and allows for more efficient use of time for those that can make
good use of the additional creative flexibility.

Somehow though, I know that many of the best applicants will be buried in the
mountains of quality of *applications* (screeners being able to determine so
little about the applicant himself from an application).
I myself will admit to having fired off an application a while ago, and yet
no one's ever visited the demo URL's I included.. PR working a little too well
guys? ;)

So, that leads to the question, is there a way to expand great events like
this without diluting their value? Perhaps the main challenge is financing.
Since this is "startup *school*" when do you expect financial assistance from
wealthy alumni?

In the end, the value of this program to all of those that didn't get in will
be motivational. This may be all that some groups need, but For those that
really need funding because they have a product thats months from really
becoming  profitable is there anywhere else that one can look? Most
alternatives weigh heavily on traditional factors such as school grades yet it
appears that many of the most successful felt no need to excel in these areas. And no, borrowing money for a summer job is not an option for any student I
know.

At any rate, this looks like a good event.
You live in UK, and you want to build a business? Start selling tinfoil hats for ID cards!

It is good to split by language, because it would annoy most people to get 20 different languages on a frontpage (or it would annoy every non-english to never so anything non-english on frontpage rather).

The problem is mostly one of consumer loyalty.  Most people are more loyal to entertainment brands (stars like Brad Pitt, directors like Peter Jackson, characters like Shrek, sometimes studios like Pixar) than they are to technology brands.  That's because entertainment brands are emotionally appealing.  Most people don't choose one movie over another because of price, or (usually) because it's distributed by one company or another.  They want to see the latest film that has their favorite star in it, or that was directed by their favorite director, or in a more recent trend, that is based on their favorite video game or book or TV show.

Could Intel (or some other tech company) buy the rights to some of these brands, hire some independent filmmakers to make film versions of video games they managed to option the rights on, etc.?  Maybe.  But the RIAA members still control virtually all of the properties that are worth anything today.  Unless the tech companies make a serious committment to buying and developing entertainment properties for the long haul, people will be afraid to work with them.  Remember that most people who work in the entertainment business move around between companies and projects every few years.  But someone who goes to do a project for Intel may have to rely on Intel's good fortune and good graces forever, since everyone in the business will know that they were in bed with "The Enemy" and will be loathe to touch them.

Hollywood didn't get where it is by playing fair.  It will fight dirty to keep a tight hold on its top properties.


The problem is that everyone who questions certain aspects of evo theory gets lumped together with Creationists and ID'ers.  There are some questioning from a more scientific basis.  Questions need to be asked in order to hone the theory, to continue to improve it.  If we start taking a dogmatic stance on evolution then we're as bad as the Creationists and ID'ers, aren't we?

Don't worry, you're plenty safe with your evolutionary beliefs in both US and European Universities where Darwinism reigns supreme. It's a bit alarmist to suggest that evolution is in any danger of losing it's grip at this point.

However if you question evolutionary theory (even if you're not a Creationist or ID'er) in any way you'll experience all kinds of discrimination - if you're a grad student you won't get funding and if you're PhD or post-doc you're not gonna get a position with the Uni. A lot of focus has been on the Creationist/ID'ers, but really, there are others of us out here who are questioning from a more scientific standpoint. Not that we want to throw out the whole theory, but there are some rather problematic bits.

But if you're willing to work for peanuts there's lots of fun to be had!

Seriously, though, in order to do make software dev your career in the US at this point you have to be willing to live with a lot of uncertainty - there's no such thing as a permanent job anymore, though, there probably never really was (we were able to live with the illusion, though :).  You also have to be willing to live on a lot less than you would have in the past.  These things aren't all bad , I think the uncertainty now is spurring a lot of software developers to go ahead and take the risk of starting their own companies....though it's kind of hard to buy a house or car on credit when you can't point to a consistent income stream and you don't know if you'll have a consistent income stream one, two or five years from now.  Still, people are realizing that working for a corporation is really no more secure than working for yourself people are more willing to take the plunge and that should lead to a lot of innovation which isn't possible in the big-corporate environment.

Stop thinking about computer science as a way to get a job and start thinking about it as as one of the most important (but not the only) tool in the belt of a person who is able to understand the world, describe how it works, and build wonderful things.

Yeah, you could build reddit, but that's one of the least interesting things you could do...
It is already possible to compile server-side javascript into Java bycode via Rihno.  See mature framework such as http:://helma.org
It is a scripting language, but has all the advantage of a system language. Best of both worlds.
Students drop because the weed out classes are tough, they think that the field is too mathematical (automata theory -- it is not), and sometimes have a hard time understanding complex software and complex programming languages (anything with pointers).  

So your average college student won't be attracted to it.  
Second, the big money in CS is coming from graduate training.  Implementing "complex" statistical algorithms (aka an enterprise Bayesian spam filter -- ok so not so complicated.. but it requires 3 different ways of thinking (statistical, algorithmic, performance/complex systems for unix or linux) to produce a working system.  Not many people get this training.  So big money follows bigger ideas.  In fact colleges need to start training people to think in these areas.  I dunno, but I wasn't exposed to statistics or linear algebra until graduate school.  And I went to a top CS undergrad institution.

Most with a pre-aptitude for computers stick with it.  As the Xbox generation matures I think more people will enter CS in general.

There is a certain amount of dogmatism about evolution in some places, and ID will probably exacerbate that. I don't think that's the biggest problem though. In my opinon, the biggest problem is that there are so many people who don't really understand the difference between physical theories of causation (or potential histories of causation) and metaphysical claims of absolute truth.
Neh, I'm not convinced that there is that large (or unusual) a backlash against modifications to Darwinian evolution within the community.  Punctuated equilibria, for instance, are a necessary modification to evolutionary theory in order to explain certain phenomena.  Scientists have always had their 'pet theories' that lead to disregard for evidence and dogmatism, but that's a far cry from the claims the creationists make.

I have yet to hear an ID proponent admit that the only scientifically valid form of ID involves alien life 'seeding' our planet.
Yes.  My university offers a plethora of different computing-related degrees with various levels of emphasis on theory.  I'm in what's supposedly the most theory-oriented of them but I still feel like I spend too much of my time learning how to maintain other peoples' Java programs.  For just that reason I'm now doubling in Mathematics.
Exactly. The only problem is that there are many many people who think that their favorite claim of divinely revealed absolute truth is far more certain to be true than any mere man-made theory. To them, your argument is completely backwards.

In my opinion, the single biggest problem is that most people do not understand the problems with claims to absolute truth.

No doubt, your performance is reduced because of the fragmentation on your disk. The fact is, that all the defragmentation utilities can help only when the problem is minor. If you want to make sure the fragmentation level is just about to become high, you have to measure it.
There is a way to measure it. Lacelevel2 is the name of the free program which will do the job. Download it from www.disklace.com
There's a list of the ones that have launched so far in the YC faq (http://ycombinator.com/faq.html).  Basically Reddit, Kiko, Clickfacts, and Textpayme, plus Pixoh, which hadn't meant to launch yet but was outed by this article.

The scaling-up *does* have an effect. The difference in a small town is all those people observing each other also *know* each other. And when I say "know each other", I really mean "care about each other", but not in the touchy-feely sense, but in the "hey, that guy's my neighbor, and I wouldn't like it very much if anybody messed around with his life" sense. If you live in this small town and you see somebody doing something "suspicious" you say, "Hey, Mike, what's up? What're ya doin' there?" Then they tell you, and you say, "Oh, *OK*. For a second there, it looked like you were conspiring to blow us all up! Ha, ha, isn't that hilarious?" And everything is happy. When it's the government observing 1000's of people that meaning *nothing* to them, they don't care if what they're observing is really what they think they're observing (because they don't care at all about those people they're observing) and they just start arresting all the suspected terrorists.

An analogy of A to B is useful only if you can generate interesting hypotheses about A from the characteristics of B.

Saying an economy is like an algorithm in action is useful if an economy has some attributes of an algorithm in action. An algorithm has input and output, has a big-O requirement of space and time in terms of input size, is terminating/non-terminating etc. etc. None of these lead to any INTERESTING hypotheses about an economy.

That is why the guy is a moron.

There's a two-pronged attack on CS and he sees only one.  He sees that students who want real-world jobs are culled off by the impracticality of it all.  The universities now reach out to those students and teach them what they want to hear.  (java!  databases!  buzzwords!  'algorithms'?  'lisp'?)

I was culled off by the other attack.  The universities themselves, outside of a few well-regarded bulwarks, are so intent on bringing in the industrial-programmers-to-be that they estrange the people who want to do research.

I wanted training as a theoretician and they offered me occupational training.  It's not just external forces at work.
topical subreddits, to me at least, seem to be conceptually equivalent to 'recommended' pages pretrained around certain topics.  Except that the pretraining is just people submitting under a particular topic.  I'm not entirely sure how this is much different from tagging.

In general, you can figure it out by looking at the size (thickness) of the struts. Where they alter is where the join occurred.

For example, in the fourth (last) image you can see the thickness of the twisty bar get larger and larger... until the upper-right join. Then it is small again. So right there, you can see how the join was created.

The second image is simlar... in that case there are two joins because of the complexity of the object. One behind the horizontal strut (the back bar does not actually touch the horizontal bar), and another somewhere in the top arch... I can't tell where.

Ok, I finally have to comment on what has bothered me for years.  In Euclidian space, what is time travel relative to?  

The surface of our planet is spinning at ~1,000 mph.  It is orbiting Sol at ~65k mph.  We live on a spiral galaxy, so it, too, is turning, and God only knows what our galaxy is doing in relationship to it's neighbors, near and far.

Just the surface travel at the equator, after a one-second time jump either way, would put you ~1,500 feet from where you started, which would hang you in air or embed you in stone.
Just because you can't see a similarity doesn't mean there isn't one. The interesting characteristic of algorithms in this case is not that they may or may not terminate, but that they are a powerful way of describing processes. The interesting hypothesis is that you can describe or simulate an economy with an algorithm better than you can describe it with anything else. It's interesting because that would be useful, and it might be true. Algorithms are a much more flexible and powerful way of doing it than mathematical equations, which was the best thing going until modern computers.

If you didn't get that, you pretty much missed the entire point of the paper.

The good news is that Maher Arar was released and returned to Canada in October 2003: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maher_Arar

The link also gives some reasons as to why the US and probably Canada suspected Arar was linked to al-Qaeda:

"During a stopover at JFK Airport he was detained by United States immigration officials. They claimed that Arar was an associate of Abdullah Almalki, a Syrian-born Ottawa man whom they suspected of having links to the al-Qaeda terror organization, and they therefore suspected Arar of being an al-Qaeda member himself. When Arar protested that he only had a casual relationship with Almalki (having once worked with Almalki's brother at an Ottawa high-tech firm), the officials produced a copy of Arar's 1997 rental lease which Almalki had co-signed. The fact that US officials had a Canadian document in their possession was later widely interpreted as evidence of the participation by Canadian authorities in Arar's detention."

The thing is that for 1/5 the cost of a fab, Intel could just outright BUY the entire film library of most any movie studio.  What are the rights to all of the movies released last year worth?  a fair bit-mostly from DVD sales, but a hell of a lot less than $5B.  If Intel offered to buy the rights of every movie released before 2000 by a single major studio, they could probably get it for on the order of $1B.  If they purchased everything but the very most expensive properties, (everything that is presently making approximately 0 money for content companies, essentially), they could do it for a lot less.  Let the content guys keep Star Wars, James Bond, and a handful of other big-ticket properties, and try to make money on them.  Take the rest and make it free.  If you are intel, and doing this drives people to buy more chips, it would be a pretty big win.

The same thing applies with apple and Ipods.  They should just go and buy a few record labels, and let that music be free, at least on Itunes.  It would drive adoption like crazy, I bet.

I think that according to our (or at least _my_) present understanding of physics in order to travel through time you would need to find an area of space time that loops back on itself (a wormhole) and travel through it. If you did this you wouldn't disappear and then reappear you would just move in a different direction through time relative to your desired start and end points.

Note: this is based on a very non-detailed (ie amateur) understanding of the possibility of real time travel as informed by this book, [How to Build a Time Machine](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142001864/sr=8-1/qid=1140566013/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0090984-4756726?%5Fencoding=UTF8).

I liked this article because it provides evidence against a few of the myths espoused either explicitly or implicitly by evolutionist: that a belief in evolution is relevant to the ability to do good science, that smart people don't believe in creationism, and that there is no debate between evolution and creationism. When approximately half of science students believe in creationism it's hard to dismiss it as simply the beliefs of "dumbasses", although some are still trying. (See comment by annoymous_hater.)

I don't think there are any scientists out there claiming that evolution is a perfect theory...otherwise there wouldn't need to be evolutionary biologists.  There is still a fair amount of debate about how evolution occurs (see neutral theory, punctuated equilibrium, etc.).  However, we KNOW that species change over time and evolve into different forms, yet there are people out there who would like to deny this possibility.  I generally like to think that they are only able to believe this because they are uneducated or are not interested in thinking about it logically, which is why this article worried me.

Geometry started off as measuring earth, but later evolved into generally applicable mathematics, and computer science will follow the same trend"

This is my view on the situation, I posted this the same reply at the original article but I wanted to post here as well for some feedback:

***

Quote: "The big paradox is that the computer science revolution is just unfolding," Chazelle said. "Why, then, are students are running away from it; why is there this decline when the field has never been more exciting?"

A paradox is only a paradox as long as you don't have a new model that incorporates both of the seemingly opposite phenomena.

The reason is freedom, or lack of it.
There are different classes of "programmers". There are the guys that find computer science challenging and fun to do but follow the dogma of CS of the time. Then there are the people who see what others can't. The people who think to themselves: "Why are they doing things this way? Isn't it obvious to them it's better to do it THIS way?". The renegades, the future "Einsteins" of CS in a way.

Well these kinds of people will be the last to try to make a living out of CS in the U.S.A or Japan. Why?

SOFTWARE PATENTS.

Even if they don't realize it conciously. The smart ones will feel, correctly, that the way the system is set up at the moment will punish exploring the undiscovered country of computer science. It will punish the brilliant minds with anxiety and fear because anything they discover will either be taken away from them or sued out of existence by the big players with their huge patent portfolios.

Let me ask you a question.

Do you think the explorers that first colonized America would have gone forth into the wild west if they had a rubber band attached to their wagon that would yank them back as soon as they found some prime piece of land to colonize? A rubber band held onto by the old money of Europe that they were running away from.

Or would Einstein have gone into physics if anything he came up with would be attributed to his idiot colleagues. Colleagues who would then block any newer discoveries if they even remotely resembled what Einstein came up with? Einstein would realize that he would be working against discovering even newer revelations by coming up with the intervening steps of discovery. A catch 22. A dictatorship of knowledge.

Something similar exists today in the US and Japan today. Early programmers learn that there is a bad pattern of programming called "spaghetti code". It's a pattern of programming that creates seemingly invisible connections in your computer code that will create unforseen consequences that will crash your program. It's almost impossible to debug using the human mind so the early programmers correctly said: "Fuck this, this system is obviously flawed. Instead of trying to figure this out it's better to completely scrap the system and create a new one, a new programming language that prevents spaghetti code in the first place".

Well guess what, people who see the invisible, people who have the potential to become the new "Einstein of CS" see that ANY program he/she creates is automatically spaghetti coded, automatically hooked, automatically rubber-banded to the big corporations by law. By SOFTWARE patent law. ANY program anyone writes will always have a couple of algorithms that are patented. That's just the nature of programming. Anything the programmer creates can be taken away by a corporation that gets greedy or an attorney who wants to climb the corporate ladder. Why would a genius, who subconciously gets this automatically, ever risk his livelyhood and maybe even risk the greater future discoveries of other "explorers" by going along with this system?

He or she will rightly say "Fuck this, this system is obviously flawed. Instead of trying to figure a way out of this problem it's better to completely forget about programming and either go into law-school... OR GO TO A COUNTRY WHICH DOESN'T HAVE SOFTWARE PATENTS! Yeah, that's IT!"

A personal story, the day I heard that the European Union was planning to introduce software patents, I felts physical terror. I KNEW it would destroy any future success a lone programmer, a rogue explorer would be able to have in a world where US corporations would say: "Yeah, it's a revolutionary program all right, but eh, you used a scrollbar so you either sell your company to us or sue your program out of existence". I almost became religious after the programmers of Europe and abroad united to defeat software patent law in a front of logic and rationality.

The U.S.A and Japan better realize that they will either stunt the potential of their own future "Einsteins" or suffer a brain drain of brilliant programmers into Europe where there's still the freedom to explore and reap the benefits of their discoveries.

The more they try to keep their control over ideas into their hands and squeeze, the more the good programmers will squeeze through their fingers. Wasn't it mainly out of principle against total control that Einstein fled to the US? The world is run by greedy idiots, swear to god.

Hopes that solves the "paradox" :)

***

And I want to add that only idiots would need software patents to protect their livelihood. If you take a broader view and if you'd like to generally promote good hackers into computer science and gently dissuade lesser programmers to go into the field then, as a country, you should do away with software patents. The smarter ones will be able to stay ahead of the rest anyway and if you look at the reality of today's software industry, does Google need SOFTWARE patents, does Microsoft even need SOFTWARE patents? The only ones that are using software patents at the moment are the leeches of society.

If you really think algorithms are an expanded form of mathematics, and that they are the future of science, then you should lure the smart people in instead of punishing the "Einsteins" with anxiety and stress for their insights of this "spaghetti code of law".
The Dutch call this field of study: "Informatics" too. Even though I think it comes closer, I still think it doesn't reflect the field correctly. It's not just information that's being studied, it's also the transformation of information by a process.

Maybe "ComputING Science" or "Information Processing Science" is a better word. IPS has a nice ring to it.
If I were Richard Rorty, and aware of this little graffito of yours, I'd be kinda pissed.  No one is going to be persuaded to read him based on your ... endorsement here.  Some of us are going to conclude that he's the kind of professor who attracts fanatic asshole disciples who go out and prosletyze.

And speaking of prosletyzing, if you're going to claim that your ideas will change the way people think about *absolutely everything*, you might do them the service of arguing them persuasively.  Correct capitilization and punctuation would help too.
This is the socialist/left variety of anarchy, rather than the libertarian imagined-wild-west sort.

Damn interesting, I never really expected a working (to some degree) modern day example from either flavour.

--

Edit: I worded that poorly. I don't mean to suggest that Somalia has a special brand of anarchy that is incompatible with hypothetical libertarian societies. I mean that as an example of a real-world society that _supposedly_ shows anarchy working, this one is commune based, not individual-liberty based.
You lost me after you segued from software patents to the exploration and colonization of the New World.  Less is more.
I agree. There is a certain insight that you can only get by doing something like becoming a hacker.
I thought those two are people's expectations for how a stateless society would work.  Neither one relies on agressive force.  How are they different, or incompatible?
It seems that while an up arrow means it was worth seeing, 'save' means it will be worth seeing again.  If default decay times are fast enough, letting saves slow it down might work well.
Every anarchist has different ideas, but one camp is founded on community obligation (in this case your clan), the other is the freedom of every man for himself.

&gt;While clansmen are under no obligation to share their wealth with other clans, they must share it to a significant extent within the clan. Van Notten notes this as a drawback and states that the "law makes clansmen somewhat a prisoner of their clan." 

That would have the libertarian variety anarchist spitting tacks, they'd label it communism (or theft).

(only extreme libertarians want to get rid of government altogether)
"You lost me after you segued from software patents to the exploration and colonization of the New World. Less is more."

I'm still learning how best to speak my mind. I was aiming for more of a subconcious effect. You're right that it won't work if I lose people that stop reading. I'll let it stand as it is. Thanks for the feedback.

The problem with CS is that it's currently fighting with "Software Engineering" for funds and attention.  The two fields are orthogonal except for the first two years or so of undergraduate material.

So play-it-safe kids who want nice stable jobs and high grade point averages have to endure automata theory; would-be theoreticians have to learn code-commenting standards, OOP, and java, which is to a real programming language what toilet paper is to a painter's canvas.

This guy should be leading the charge to expel anyone who's ever published on "programmer productivity metrics" from his discipline, rather than whining about how nobody wants to go to school to study the art of filling out TPS reports.

You can believe in creationism all you want, denying that there is absolutely no factual evidence for it is the thing that gets you called "dumbass".
All you have to do is troll a thread, and the Reddit software lowers it to the bottom (by averaging out the points, apparently). Geez.
&gt; The truth is that we are no different than any other nation. Lets facet it, there isn’t one war or foreign policy that America has gone into for the sake of another country or another person.

I'll have to pick you up here. America is by no means perfect, but there's significant differences between American freedoms and say China, Iran and North Korea. As for the wars, compared to Germany and Japan, America was clearly doing the right thing in helping to liberate Europe and Asia.
Quote: "Computer science is the formalization of processes, or imperative knowledge, whereas math is the formalization of declarative knowledge...People tend to confuse the essence of a field with its tools"

Does that mean that processes can only be described by imperative programming? What about functional programming? Don't they describe processes declaratively?

Or is it that a declarative "algorithm" is more of a black box that will change the information that is input without adjusting the black box at all, so that the way you structure the input is kind of the "algorithm".

I'm asking because I want to start programming in a functional language, Erlang. Thanks in advance.
With the caveat that taste and style are personal choices, when I read this it sounded like my mother trying to dress me.

"In linguistics, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (SWH) states that there is a systematic relationship between the grammatical categories of the language a person speaks and how that person both understands the world and behaves in it. This controversial hypothesis is named after the linguist and anthropologist Edward Sapir and his colleague and student Benjamin Whorf."

Many anarchocapitalists would look the same way upon someone who didn't have a contract with any Private Defense Agency.

&gt; Does that mean that processes can only be described by
&gt; imperative programming? 

He's one of the co-authors of the best textbook ever written for CS, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which is also IMO the best introduction to functional programming (It uses purely functional programming for the first three chapters, and stays mostly functional for the other two). So he's talking about functional languages, too. Incidentally, if you want to start functional programming, I would suggest learning Scheme from SICP; it will easily translate to Erlang.  

What he means is that he's talking about processes that you can turn into something a computer can do. Declarative knowledge just talks about facts about the world; imperative knowledge talks about how to do stuff, or find answers. Functional programming is a way to tell a computer how to do stuff; it just isn't imperative in the sense that it doesn't use destructive state-changing operations. It doesn't describe processes declaratively. 

Prolog, on the other hand, is declarative. Programming in Prolog is entering facts, and then telling the logic system to infer some consequences from those facts.

I find reading these articles about the "dollar hegemony" as if it was some sort of pyramid scheme.  The connection between one line of reasoning and the next is a little unclear.  Can someone please explain in a well reasoned manner exactly how the choice of a unit of account really is so important strategically to the US?  I doubt that the link is there.

My own guess is that if the unit of account changes overnight to the Euro, it might create some short term illiquidities, (no pun intended), but people will adapt quickly as the price of oil really is independent of the currency that it is quoted in (which depends on supply and demand).

But I am always open to thoughtful commentary.
&gt; and that since the demise of the central government, the Somali shilling has become far more stable in world currency markets, while exports have quintupled.

"when you're my age, you pay more attention to what a man does, and less to what he says" .. Dr. Krakt
not my problem if you don't care for my style, or if rorty doesn't. conclude what you want, i didn't say it would change anything, let alone absolutely everything.

lots of idiots are attracted to lots of smart people, thinking less of the smart people is a pretty hasty generalization.

i gave up arguing persuasively on the internets a long time ago, when i realized most people 1) already have their opinion formed 2) won't take the time to follow a persuasive opinion anyway. sorry if you are in the minority and you'd like me to spell everything out for you. but i won't. if you want to understand rorty, you'll just have to read some. if you don't want to, or just want to criticize everything around you, go on ahead. 

it is after all, what i do most of the time.

I've found this an interesting problem as well. The whole BTTF premise of "through time but not through space" makes a lot of sense, but it's all still just relative to the surface of the Earth...
If you use a mac, but your bank doesn't support using a mac to download transactions and balance account, you'll want to read this.  Evidentally you can make it work just by tweaking the file from WebConnect.  I may actually start using Quicken again if this works right.
Nations don't have rights.  Most of the time when we say a nation we mean a government, and any power the government has comes by violating the rights of the people.  This is a very sad and infuriating example of what happens when a government does not respect the rights of its citizens.

The US government was almost an exception to the rule that people in power will use that power to hurt others.  It's just a matter of degree, and it's getting worse.

What happened to Arar is wrong.  No matter how you slice it.

I guess overall it is not that bad.

A voice call for authorisation is kind of crappy.  

It means that on the company side you seriously impact the duration of a transaction and even how well you can scale.

On the client side it is kind of unfriendly to rely on voice for authorisation.  I currently do transactions much more secure and instantanious without any of these.

Also verbal transmission of pin information just itches me somewhere.  a) You have someone else who knows your pin (unless you use some kind of ivr) and b) Someone can overhear you when you give it over the phone.
sweater vests scream geek if you're wearing it over a shirt with a pocket protector. but i agree with her, there are plenty of hip hop artists, like common, who look pretty dapper in them. and nerd chic looks pretty good on a lot of people too.

and yeah,i agree that style and taste are a personal choice, but that doesn't mean people can't dispense advice. where would the instyles and luckys and gqs be without it. and come on, whether you want to believe it or not, it wouldn't hurt to give some people advice. my boyfriend was one of them.

Problem I see with the lack of privacy is the people who keep an eye on us.  If I could trust my government to spy on people they thought were bad... great!  However, what's to stop them from spying on political opponants?  Eric Schmidt to see how Google stock is going to perform?  Their wife?

The whole concept of checks and balances is that governments cannot be trusted.
I assumed the voice call was automated - that would scale somewhat. And that you entered the pin via the keypad.
That would help, but setting it up is far from trivial :)
&gt; Bottom line is: today's American voters are responsible for what does America today, full stop

This is false. If you voted for Bush in 2000 how were you responsible for the Invasion of Iraq? Bush never mentioned it in 2000 - so you didn't have full discloure (for obvious reasons) - therefore you're are not directly responsible.
&gt; As for your "China Iran etc. to worse than us" argument, 
&gt; imagine it transposed in a common criminal context: "I'll 
&gt; have to pick you up here, your honor. I'm by no mean perfect
&gt; as I have indeed raped and killed this woman, but 
&gt; ${SOMEFAMOUSRAPIST} raped and killed much more people, 
&gt; including children". Not sure you'd convince a jury that  way.

Irrelevant. The OP made the claim that the US was no worse than other countries. That's clearly not true. Check what the UN and Amnesty have to say about human rights in China compared to the US.
&gt; Will you ever stop to justify current "moral" grounds with 
&gt; what's been done during WWII, by soldiers who're now mostly 
&gt; dead (not mentionning that obviously, it's been done for 
&gt; strictly national interests, as just every war)

Who's justifying anything? I'm not. I'm just picking up the OP for making a claim that the US has never gone to war for the sake of another country.
I wonder if there are any VOIP APIs that mean you don't need loads of phone lines to send out automated calls?
Information Overload discussed

The SWH is one of those things that you know is kind of true, but also kind of not. In most cases, it's society that forms language rather than the other way around. Japan didn't always have a bucket load of polite ways to say things, that only happened after the feudal age dragged on for too long. In this case, if we were doing CS right, we'd probably talk about it right too. Probably, changing our words is a good first step on the path to right action, though.
I find it interesting she (and presumably the author of the book) doesn't mention the millions killed. And I find disingenuous to say that democracy caused the warlords -- I somehow doubt they would have all sat around peacefully herding sheep had no attempt towards central government been made, but cheap weapons were available.

I would also be very curious as to the rights and roles of women, and non-warrior types. And what about just coming from a smaller, weaker Jilib? The whole thing seems rather one sided, and doesn't jibe with the violence and fear that seems to be associated with such tribalism seen elsewhere in the world.

That said, I think imposing a form of government on a people who aren't ready for it, or don't want it, is doomed to failure. Measuring whether the people don't want it is a bit tricky, since it involves taking some power away from those who have, which is never a happy proposition.
These bikers don't seem like your typical drug-dealing motorcycle gang.  In fact, I would think such groups make up a miniscule minority of bikers, particularly with the influx of mid-life crisis bikers.  Just look at Sturgis these days.  So the probability that its just a PR stunt is pretty low, and its a little insulting to the bikers I know, who are good honest people.

I think your conception of Snoop Dogg's business as "community destroying" is similarly out of touch, as is your need to qualify Snoop as "gansta," particularly with scare quotes around it.

These are just stereotypes that the media uses to scare people, and though they're good at getting people to listen to the local news or buy a magazine, they're not particularly true.  There's no need to perpetuate them.

A "persuasive opinion" is, by definition, one that persuades people. If you're not persuading others, then you aren't persuasive. I would say that you're right that arguing on the internet usually doesn't result in people changing their opinion. However, it sometimes does. I read a good piece by Dennett on the role of religion in the public square, and I changed my opinion. Then I thought about it some more and changed my opinion back. Still, I felt like I learned something.

You made a good point, which I recognized from Rorty: People tend to think that the things they're into are the absolute coolest things ever, and everyone should love it. His example was his love of bird watching or something like that. I've read an accusation that Paul Graham is doing that when he says hackers are like painters. 

Anyhow, that point was lost in your original message, because you switched up ideas one after another with no follow up. When you write, you should give the reader enough rope to let them draw the conclusion that you're pushing on their own. Then give them the conclusion on a silver platter, in case they missed it. Firing off five interesting things with no obvious connection between them and a hostile vibe isn't really a good way to get people onto your side. 

Try to step back and think about what you're arguing, including all the mechanics that you'd prefer to skip over. If you don't explain things to the degree that it feels like too much to you, it probably won't be enough for the reader, since they have their own minds and might not naturally follow an idea down the same path that you do.

It's from an institute pushing libertarianism, expect a lop-sided picture.
True, it would be hard to hold one accountable for the Iraq invasion on a 2000 Bush vote. However, functional accountability in the US democracy is more complex than the last vote cast. 

Public reaction, guaged through press coverage, lobbying efforts, opinion polls, and home-district canvasing by elected officials and staff all serve to inform the *professional* politicians of the distance they had to move on the Iraq thrust before risking involuntarily retirement.

Unfortunately, the shit news networks do a better job of reminding the well washed masses of rag wearing insurgents and noble soldiers than the human beings unfortunate enough to find themselves caught up in that mess. Too bad -- we have too much priveledge and opportunity at our fingertips to plead innocence.

Either a majority of the electorate was too apathetic, ignorant or supportive (effectively the same thing) during the buildup to war, or we are not a democracy.
Cool feature.  Nature mag also has its own podcast as well.
Just a comment on your original post: I think I agreed with you, but I couldn't figure out for sure because you left words out, didn't form full sentences, and didn't punctuate properly. I think that's where your minus points came from, not your content.

I'm hoping this will become something of a self-correcting problem. Fewer graduates means more money and better job prospects for the ones who do study CS, which will encourage more students. This, of course, presumes that the number of jobs doesn't shrink as fast as the number of graduates. However, I think people are waking up to the fact that it's not always the best idea to have someone from a different culture, in a different timezone, (maybe) speaking a different language working on the core of your business. And India is getting more expensive anyway.


As to the information theory side of CS vs. the practical side, I think it's healthy when the two are somewhat mixed, with more emphasis on theoretical aspects at university. I've been programming professionally for the last ten years now (eep!) and definitely used some of my theoretical background directly, and more indirectly (in terms of how it affected my thinking), but I find it arrogant and misguided to completely ignore actually doing something. That, to me, becomes like Aristotle just sitting around imagining experiments, rather than doing any, and getting stuff wrong....

Damn right.

This is not about good or evil. Just people standing up for whatever they believe.

Gangsta is a term meaning social outlaw around the black community. Gangstas are not inherently bad. They just have no where to turn and needed the money. In fact if you ever bother to listen to gangsta rap, (50cent doesnt count) you will realize most of them are fighting against social inequality not agaist law and order. Snoop Dogg is not even a violent rapper, his lyrics mostly concentrate on parties and women.
Well I've been living with Ubuntu for the last few days and well frankly it sucks.
I'm sorry to disagree harshly but I see a disturbing trend in popular games to be less abstract and more concrete.  Concrete in the sense that the games are realistic and there's little room for interpretation.  I can see why this is popular.  As with watching TV, it is comforting to be able to take a break from thinking.  

Math, CS and games such as chess and even simple checkers and tic-tac-toe are all, IMO, abstract.  In that these all (okay, some may argue about math) only have value because we assign value to them in our minds.  To the uninitiated, all look like rather silly wastes of time.

One ray of hope for me is the new trend in Japan for old style (more abstract?) games.  That just might provide the salvation you envision but for opposite reasons.

To be even more general, I just think people want to feel good.  The problem is that large parts of popular culture endorse feeling good now, in the present, at the expense of pain later.  The concrete games, TV, McD's and recreational drugs (including alcohol) are examples of this lifestyle.  At least when taken to extreme.

I think it's healthier to be willing to be accept a little discomfort in the present in return for feeling good later.  Examples are exercise, practice the piano, saving money, helping others and even working toward a CS degree.  Now... how to convince the next generation?

At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.

You are an asshole tele64.
The laws would have to be narrowly defined and content neutral. I think they could get away with laws that restricted protesting a private funeral as long as they made the law very specific so it could not expand to other venues.

I just can't believe how sick these people are, thanking God that soldiers died, because they were protecting a country that harbored homosexuals, this country being THE SAME ONE THEY FUCKING LIVE IN! This guy must have a cult going on.
That said, I'm not sure if a law is the best answer, but these people are retarded.

You're assuming that those libraries are for sale at any reasonable price.  I don't think any of the major studios would sell anything that would really be worth having to a tech company.  They're intangible assets which means they are effectively priceless.  If you sell a fab you can always build a newer, better one.  If you sell the rights to old movies, you might retain the right to do remakes and sequels, but you can't really replace the originals.  I think the studios consider those to be core assets.  It would be like Intel selling all of the chip designs they ever created or bought.  The equivalent to a fab in the entertainment business would be more like a set of sound stages with cameras and such, not the content library.

&gt; I liked this article because it provides evidence against a few of the myths espoused either explicitly or implicitly by evolutionist: that a belief in evolution is relevant to the ability to do good science, that smart people don't believe in creationism, and that there is no debate between evolution and creationism.

 * A good understanding of well-established theories (whether you believe them or not) *is* relevant to the ability to do good science. The problem with Creationists is generally not that they disbelieve evolutionary theory but that their understanding of it is so unbelievably bad -- usually deliberately.

 * Of course there are smart people who believe in Creationism. Smart people often believe stupid things.

 * Depends on how you define "debate". There are plenty of people who make all sorts of spurious claims about evolution, blatantly misrepresent the theory, and then use those strawman arguments to claim that they have vanquished it. I don't call that a debate, but you might.

What *exactly* are the beliefs of those "half of all science students" you mention? Are they all Biblical Literalists? Young-Earth Creationists? Or are a significant portion of them "creationists" in that they generally believe that God designed the universe and life -- even if scientifically verified means like evolution and the Big Bang are the way he did it?

Kind of a big difference. Which is why those differences are generally glossed over by Creationists.

Maybe you should submit the Snopes link to Reddit.
The reason why evolution is not believed by many thinking and competent people is that the only way we know of to produce complex machines is by intelligent design. Without the intervention of an an intelligent designer or process, complex machines break down over time. They do not "evolve".
A watch left to itself will eventually turn into a pile of dust. To believe the opposite, that a pile of dust will eventually turn into a watch, requires too much faith for many people. 
Living organisms are much more complex than watches. Why they should be more likely to form themselves from dust (or soup) than watches is unclear. 
Therefore, the first reasonable explanation for the origin of life involves an intelligent creator. To convince a reasonable person otherwise requires a lot of evidence about the power of random, purposeless processes to create useful machines. Evidence which is not forthcoming from evolutionists. In fact, if anything, biologists seem to be teaching that life is even more complex, less likely to be produced without purpose, than previously thought. 
For example, I just recently learned about the Toxoplasma parasite and its effect on rats. The hand-waving arguments of evolutionists on how this could have evolved just don't seem credible. The most reasonable explanation to me on how something like this could have come about, involve devolution of Toxoplasma. I.e., Toxoplasma started out with many more efects on rats, but over time, it lost most of these effects (because of the natural process of degeneration) until now all  that remains is an effect on the rat's fear response. This explanation fits a creationist model much better than an evolutionist model.

I have one or two comments (taken from my own experience - I am a young mathematician, working in France) about the prestige and the money : you do as if they couldn't be part of the "fun". Why ? I really love giving conferences or lectures (at least when the audience doesn't get lost...), or helping people around me (colleagues that I like, but who are not necessarily "friends" - my french notion may not be the same as yours) by organizing a seminar or something else. Now : (i) the "prestige" is part of the pleasure (it's good to feel you're helping people around you, and to imagine this little image of you travelling in some places you've never been) and (ii) the more famous you are, the more people you don't know are likely to come to you, and become people you know. I hope this last sentence was comprehensible...

About the money, I would first say (as I used to when I was 18) that it doesn't matter *that much*. Now that I pay my own holiday trips and try to invite my wife in nice restaurants, I would reconsider my answer : you should not *accept* a poor salary if you think you are doing a great job : you may take it if this is your best option at a given moment, but never give up finding a better one. 
As far as I am concerned, I work better in a nice flat with balcony than in some dark room lost in a noisy area. That costs money.
And what is more important is this : I think the money you get has something to do with the way the "society" acknowledges your work. In other words, a poor salary means something like : "nobody cares for what you do". Of course you may know that this is untrue, but after a while this awful idea can contaminate you. You gradually stop feeling productive and eventually lose your self-confidence (on the day your wife goes away, for instance...).

Is the watch supposed to be some sort of proof of something? Like when you photograph the person you kidnapped with the daily paper. Maybe it "proves" that the photos are real (and the objects exist in *our* space/time continuum).
&gt;that the only way we know of to produce complex machines is by intelligent design

False.  Very very false.  In fact, the complex machine you're typing on right now was most likely not "intelligently designed," but rather had its circuits laid out using random variation plus selection. Its a [common misconception](http://www.digitalmediatree.com/onelap/?35156) even among practicing engineers, but I don't think it's a very excusable misconception.

The big difference between your watch and a living organism is that life *reproduces*. More than that, it reproduces with variations, and not all of the reproductions continue on living or reproducing themselves. 

It's hard to believe that with this issue you're truly "thinking and competent" when you make such huge errors.  In fact, I half wonder if you're just making up this post to rile people up.  I don't doubt that you are a thinking and competent person on other issues, but your interpretation of your religion has blinded you from the truth.
Ah introverts... the least important social group on this planet.

Look guys (I include myself among introverts, btw), when Moshiach comes and there's world peace and prosperity you can have a rights revolution.  First, how about a Poor People's Rights Movement, a Youth Rights Movement and a Mentally Ill People's Rights Movement.

What's that?  We have all of those going right now?  All right, you can have your stupid revolution.  Just don't expect any time or money from me, I'm working for the National Youth Rights Association.
Ooh good one!  I can't believe I didn't think of that.
If they get the AI right, that really is quite neat.  My question is: what's the market?  It'll be a very cool toy, but I don't think it'll beat out a real pet.
Too many software companies (esecially "Web 2.0" companies) believe they don't have to worry about revenues because they can simply make money on advertising.

That's a myth.  This article makes the argument that its highly unlikely you're going to build a successful business relying just on Adsense revenues.
php imo does suck but this article does not do the best job elucidating that.  for one thing there was no mention of the fact that PHP does not support closures, anonymous functions, and so forth.
The same group (or a group of very similar people) showed up in West Virginia when the recent mine tragedies occured.  They said the Miners were getting Gods wrath because the US society was too acccepting of Gays - so these loons celebrated the death of the miners.


The link doesn't work.
Just as a counter-example, though, I'm an anarchist libertarian, but there's nothing objectionable about voluntary communism to me.  As long as someone is free to leave and start his own clan (not just join another in a different geographical location), the system is compatible with anarchism.  When people say "as long as you live here you have to follow our rules", even on your own property, that gets my goat.
plus the numbers show that the battery life is longer than that of the G4-based powerbooks (though not by much)
What a complete swine!
Is this what you're looking for? http://www.python.org/doc/current/ref/grammar.txt

I don't see how you can say that when there *are* alternative implementations of Python based on the reference I linked. The standard Python distribution is just one of them (CPython).
Was that a tribute, or was it a judgement? It is the height of arrogance for someone to presume they can judge someone else's entire life.

Because it's a major shift in society. Private companies are no longer respecting rights- innocent until proven guilty, has become guilty until proven innocent. I hate having to put all my stuff down after buying it at WalMart and letting the greeter go through everything to make sure I didn't hide that folding table under my t-shirt and the cashier didn't catch me (or the eyes in the sky).

Companies should treat shoppers like customers, not criminals.

I understand they have a bottom line and have to reduce theft, but there are other ways than assuming everyone in the store is a theif until proven otherwise by a search. I no longer shop at WalMart btw.
This is another reason why, on the rare occasion I actually enter a fast-food place, I get my drinks without ice.

The other reason is that ice dilutes the sugar-water, and if you're going to do something unhealthy, enjoy it!

Isn't this blog entry the equivalent of saying "a lot of people buy stupid cereal pulp fiction crap books"?  Then, "I used to think good writing was important, but then I found I wrote a real shitty story and lots of people liked it, so maybe good writing isn't so important."   I dont' know what business models are so I guess I'm clueless here, but I do know what computational complexity is.  I don't think this blog entry is helpful at all.
Excellent!

I believe it would be unwise to legislate againsts their right for free speech here.  Once the government gets rolling on curbing speech, they will not stop.  The limits will keep increasing.  And more topics would become taboo.  I think the bikers had the right idea, to support the soldiers through their solidarity.  There counter protest is the right way.  They are educating with their own actions.

I have a new found respect for bikers now.
It seems to me that [Condorcet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) based voting would be the best method. This is already used by many orginizations including [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/) which uses the [Schulze method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method).

The last thing we need to do is give Phelps and his Westboro church any more publicity than they deserve. They are trolls of the real world and live for this kind of reaction.

Phelps and his ilk are not true Christians. They can't even be used as a valid criticism of Christianity. So why is this the number one article on reddit?
Ahahaha. No.

It's the equivalent of saying "A lot of people buy soap. I used to think that people wanted sentient nuclear fusion powered robotic factories to clean themselves, but I was horribly, horribly wrong. I now realize that value to the customer and [difficulty|complexity] of engineering are completely different things."

Of course web 2.0 is still a bubble, but that's because the software doesn't provide much value, not because it's relatively easy to write. My opinion. Not Google and Yahoo's opinion, and they _do_ have the m^Mbillions and I _do not_ and they _are_ paying out the millions _despite_ my opinions, so...
Agh, those snobbish rebuttals made me cringe.
Please don't confuse Mr. Phelps' utterly bizarre biblical interpretation (if you can call it that) with Christianity.  Phelps is a nutcase who has no idea what Christ actually taught: to love your neighbor as yourself, to care for the downtrodden and outcast, etc.  Phelps believes in his own mental construct of Jesus, not the Jesus portrayed in the Bible.

Very nice review of the Verizon XV6700.  This phone in my opinion will be the Blackberry killer with its slide out keybard and push email capibility.  Watch out Blackberry, somone is on your ground!

Well, having actually read the article it says:

"I'm not sure anybody has gone to this length to stand in solidarity," she said. "It's nice that these veterans and their supporters are trying to do something. I can't imagine anything worse, your loved one is killed in Iraq and you've got to deal with Fred Phelps."

I'm not American, but doesn't "veteran", as used in the article usually mean a person that has served in the armed forces? In general do veterans deal drugs?
What, is this place becoming LiveJournal?
then it seems to me he is slandering christianity by associating himself with the term, and that the "true christians" ought to take him to task for it.

or maybe i just need to tell you about the [No True Scotsman fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman).
I wouldn't stop saving money at Walmart because of their stupid security policies.  I just walk by the bag checker.  It is fairly entertaining sometimes - because the occasional bag checker will flip and start yelling.  At Fry's they have put up a sign that states they have the right to search your bags.  Bullshit.  Just walk on by.  The contents of your bag are your property.  The bag is your property - assuming you just paid for it, of course.

I love PHP. I've never had any problems with character sets, parsing XML, or the dynamically-typed casts.
I can't seem to find a language that will do what PHP does while keeping it's easy to learn/code structure (queue Python activists here - Im open to suggestions).

Use smarty (http://smarty.php.net) and avoid "spaghetti PHP wrapped in spaghetti HTML". 

After reading a bunch of the new comments, I'm sure there's one thing we can all agree on: Coldfusion sucks.
LOL. :-)
Somehow I doubt this Paul felt his life was wasted.  The value or waste of a life is subjective, remember?
It is the state, not government, that is the problem.  More specifically it is a monopoly of State powers used in a coercive manner that is the problem.  There is nothing wrong with leadership and structure, it is when you point guns at people, steal their treasure, and force them to conform to your set of ideas that the problems start.
Yeah, I've seen my share of smarty spaghetti. Thanks.
No sources cited on some fairly damning information.  Talks about a "secret service report" that this guy somehow received?  Yet no one else has?

I'll wait for the real news.
Is it really supposed to be "helpful"? Seems like it's simply someone's shrug about the whole thing to me. I thought it was interesting, not that it taught me anything new, but it did make me contemplate for a second.
See this drive me nuts. Most of those "Business" people out there are way less smart than IT people, but they get salary way higher (cause they make the rules). Of course they have other skills too, but often they are dumb enough to give away their password for a kit-kat bar, or put a CD from a stranger in their PC. And don't let me start about their f***ng dancing emoticons that fill the pc of crap. I really wish company would stop hiring such monkeys, just because they got the money to study for an MBA paid by daddy.
Interestingly I thought this was a worthwhile link not necessarily for the specific entry, but for some of the other entries that I browsed to from it. Neat SQL tips.
Nice to see teenage blogs are of interest.

This isn't really a subreddit request as it isn't a specific subreddit.  But it occurred to me that spez's ongoing discussion of 'subreddits for groups of people' might work really well for regional/local subreddits.

People on the other side of the world may have no interest in what's happening in my home town/state/country, but I would.  Then again, as world events swing this way and that, people from outside a region might want to subscribe to that subreddit if something important is going on there.

(note you'd probably need to try this out in large metropolitan areas to start, so there were enough participants to make it worthwhile to subreddit it)

The quote from Tim Bray is just crap in this context, that is not a critism of the language but the coders.
Regarding Maurus critisism, I agree with him that these things are weird and really bad, but then every other language sucks aswell they all have their flaws (except common lisp of course ;). Know their flaws, avoid or work around them. Choosing a another language will just get you different flaws.

I believe it does support anonymous functions, using create_function(), but because the code must be given as a string, it can get pretty messy, and if done wrong it can invite injection attacks.

On a slightly different track...

The whole idea of what it is that makes a life meaningful, and isn't it tragic that no one is grieving for someone because they were a loner and/or didn't accomplish much in life is kind of funny and ironic. What does a dead person gain from having a thousand grieving friends? What does a dead person gain from having accomplished what they wanted to accomplish? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Those are the concerns of a living person. There is not a single dead person ever who gives a rats ass about what they accomplished or how much of an unloved, lonely person they were in life. They literally could not care less. There is absolutely no reason to feel sad for a dead person, ever. They are not sad. You can not feel empathy for a dead person, because they are not feeling anything at all, because they do not exist any more. You cannot empathize with that. A person might empathize with a feeling of regret while one's life flashes before one's eyes, but they are really just empathizing with their own unnecessary ruminations.

Of course this is not about empathy, this is about a living person thinking about their own life, and how horrible it would be if they died tomorrow, without ever having asked that pretty girl to go out with them or without becoming a doctor like they knew they could have if they would have applied themselves in college. It's a living person projecting their own feelings about their own death on someone else, because it's too hard to think about it directly. "Isn't it so tragic," they say, while vowing to hurry up and live better lives.

What they forget is that tragedy is also a concept of the living, about the living, that has nothing to do with the dead. What they really don't want to think about is that when they die, they will cease to exist, exactly like the person they are fervently wishing not to be like. What they can not, _must not_ admit is that when that happens, every trace they left in the universe will begin to fade, but they will no longer care, because care is only for the living. Some day, someone else will be the one to look at their corpse and think about them, and will vow to hurry up and make something of their life. In the end, the only thing that lasts beyond the grave is the judgements of your successors. The dead however, do not care about what their successors think of them. It is a conversation of the living, for the living. The living may see accomplishment or tragedy, but in the end it's just a way of trying to forget that the only thing they're playing for is something that they won't care about when the buzzer sounds.

A lot of PHP is crap. But it doesn't have to be if you're disciplined about separating markup from processing. There's a lot to be learned from the Rails "fragment" model.

That said, there are some dynamic features that I really wish PHP had, like functions as first-class objects.
From my link:

&gt;And how about those randomized place-and-route algorithms that have driven FPGA design for over a decade? Or ripup-and-retry autorouters for PC boards? The use of random design variations coupled with "fitness selection" officially qualifies as a non-leading-edge, established, routine methodology, not "the antithesis of engineering". 

Non-intelligent design is sometimes used when complexity surpasses the interest of a single mind, in circuit layout as well as areas such as scheduling.  My phrasing was imprecise,  because obviously most of a computer is designed by humans.

My point is that non-intelligent systems handle complexity and complex machines well, that we use such products all the time, and that the watch argument has yet again proven to be the sophistry in the debate.

So the way to fix the problems in an overblown templating language is to use the templating language it implements? Barftastic.
In South Dakota, there is a law that was proprosed this legislative session to make exactly that a crime. It has since been signed into law.
http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2006/156.htm

"No person may engage in any act of picketing at any funeral service during the period from one hour before the scheduled commencement of the funeral services until one 
hour after the actual completion of the funeral services."

This law was in response initially to anti-war protesters at military funerals.
i have to agree this post seems pretty fish.  "a source said" "a guy said" "so-and-so said" but no names, nothing real or substantial to the whole post.
Python sucks!
Tcl would have been an ideal choice to do what PHP does.

It's very simple, has a great C API (writing Apache modules for it has been a very fun and pleasant experience), and is very, very robust code.

As it stands, Tcl perhaps suffers from some of the same problems PHP has for building Really Big Systems, but it's a far more 'universal' language, being equally suited to whipping up dynamic web pages, creating GUI's with Tk, or testing networking equipment.
You do agree with me.

Small town life is a more 'realised' ethical community. That is why it is good.
 
Governments and corporations are almost self-confessedly unethical. They consider themselves above any law and act accordingly. History repeatedly confirms this.

But it is the *asymmetry* of their dominance that allows them. Stronger, more pervasive, more even, networks are good. They help the Kantian contradiction of unethical willing to be realised. Bad acts become actually self destructive and self suppressing.

I really want to know what I did to make this number 5 on my recommended page.
However, due to the economics of programming languages (covered on reddit here:  http://reddit.com/info?id=948 ), people get wrapped up in the one they've chosen, and have some strong reasons to promote and defend it.  In other words, there really are very few people that happily switch between 3, 4, 5 languages or more, treating them as 'tools' for the job at hand.  Most people have 1 they use for pretty much everything, and 2 isn't bad at all for 'the masses'.

&gt; You don't still believe that quality and popularity are related, do you?

Also, I never said anything about quality. You assume that I think doing things "the right way" results in high quality, which is exactly what I'm arguing *against* (and the grandparent is arguing *for*).
Sure, give it the down arrow because you don't like the language (probably not hip enough for you?), but my point is that it would have been a better PHP than PHP in that it doesn't suffer from some of the problems listed in the article complaining about PHP, and gets plenty of other things right.  Indeed, it was used in expensive commercial environments (StoryServer, AOLserver) until things like PHP and other free software environments forced more openness.

But please, feel free to contribute something to the conversation.

I don't know if it has occured to anyone using Smarty to actually read the PHP manual before installing a bloated and interpreted templating engine?!? Out of the box PHP supports a syntax such as:


&lt;% foreach( $rs as $record ): %&gt;


    // Blah blah, the usual template stuff such as.
    Name: &lt;%= $record-&gt;name %&gt;


&lt;% endforeach %&gt;


...and this syntax is simple to wrap in an object and do recursive "template includes" with.

I can see it now,

I've never been able to figure out what a person with an MBA is supposed to be able to *do*.

Can someone give me a concise summary of the skills someone with a business degree should have?
How about we stop skirting around the real issue here. PHP is not l33t enough for j00
PHP is awesome for simple web stuff, in my view.
It is a half-breed of Perl and C with a friendly library function for everything possible.

However, as a language nerd, I dislike it strongly.
(I'm speaking of PHP4, as I've not used the newer stuff)
Really, if there weren't more consistant, clear, and expressive languages readily available, I'd probably begrudgingly accept PHP as a decent DSL. However, I can't see the advantage of PHP over Python, Ruby, Perl, Io, or any other such language coupled with an easily installed templating system and a huge library of web-specific stuff.

In my gut, PHP feels like a bunch of C bindings with some syntax to glue them together.
[tinyc](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc/) is pretty useful. Once had a company I was dealing with that used the tinyc compiler to port their products (an accounting package). Theres a lesson for all you techies.

This is the same guy who claimed a few months ago that three congressmen told him that Bush called the constitution "just a goddamned piece of paper" during a cabinet meeting about USA-PATRIOT. It seemed plausible at the time, but this guy's record of being the only one to hear all these scandalous claims is pretty suspicious.

However, Cheney already admitted to one drink and that's all I need to know. When you're handling firearms that's one too many a day too recent.

The cartoonist is mistaken.  It's true that if you reduce your consumption of something, others will consume a bit more of it.  But not to the degree that you cut your consumption.  Because of that, and because the price is now slightly lower, the suppliers are now making slightly less money.       

After all, if the people in developing countries are currently willing to buy more oil than they already are at the current price, why aren't they?

Didn't we have a diamond story just recently?
the major shift in society is that 1) there are more people who care less about ethics 2) the net enables information sharing.

These multiply to increase "shrinkage" (inventory that they should have, but can't find) from these stores.  People game the system with fraudulent returns to Wal-Mart, and outright theft - often/sometimes inside jobs.

Not to mention organized crime. (My googlefu is insufficient to find an article I read about an FBI agent busting a ring of thieves doing this kind of thing.)
(En la angla) Komentario je la evoluo de Esperanto.
yea, and the majority response was, "well, we all agree that its absolute b.s. but try and explain it to your significant other around anniversary time and see what happens."
I also do this at both of these stores, especially Fry's.  They have 50 cashiers, but only one receipt guy?  I just don't have time for that.

They aren't checking your receipt because they think you stole something, they're checking it because they don't trust their cashiers.  I can tell because they're not checking my pockets, only my bags.  Out of respect for another person's dignity, I'll let them glance at my receipt if there's nobody else in line, but if there's even one person ahead of me I just walk on by.

Occasionally they get angry and say "excuse me, SIR, SIR!!" but by then everyone behind me has realized that they, too, don't need to wait in this line and follow suit...
Hi there

I am one of the people behind the site - It *totally* should give you a different set of suggestions if you add more books to your list *and* select them when you are requesting more suggestions - if you still have a problem let me know what books you are trying and I'll look into it. Over 250k people have so far got suggestions and this is the first problem like this logged

Many thanks

Try getting a $2000 gift card to Best Buy for your new fiancee. It's quite easy to say, "In response to the geopolitical injustices perpetuated by the diamond tyrants, and also my philosophical disagreements with using a naturally occuring carbon substance as a form of love and unity, I got you a gift card worth the same amount as that engagement ring."

&gt;The heart of design theory is the claim that design can be empirically detected. When you think about it, this is something we do all the time in ordinary life. We distinguish readily between the products of nature and the products of intelligence. Imagine you are walking on the beach, admiring the lovely pattern of the ripples. Yet you know that ripples are nothing more than the effect of wind on waves.
&gt;
&gt;Then suppose you come across a sand castle. Do you assume it was created by the wind and waves as well? Why not? The material constituents of the castle are nothing but sand, mud, and water, just like the ripples all around it. But we intuitively recognize that those starting materials have a different kind of order imposed upon them. Design theory merely formalizes this ordinary intuition.
&gt;
&gt;Critics say the concept of design does not belong in science. But several areas of science already deal with the detection of design. Back in 1967, I read a newspaper headline announcing that astronomers may have discovered radio messages coming from outer space. They dubbed the signals "LGM" to signify "Little Green Men." Later, however, they realized that the radio pulses were coming in a regular, recurring pattern like the flashing of a lighthouse, not an irregular pattern like the sequence of letters in a message. What they had discovered were not aliens but pulsars -- rotating stars.
&gt;
&gt;Today astronomers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence have worked out extensive criteria for recognizing if a radio signal is an encoded message or if it is just a natural phenomenon, like a pulsar. In other words, they have criteria for distinguishing between products of design and products of natural causes.
&gt;
&gt;In the same way, archeologists have worked out criteria for determining when a stone has the distinctive chip marks of a primitive tool (design), and when its shape is simply the result of weathering. Detectives are trained to distinguish murder (design) from death by natural causes. Insurance companies have steps for deciding whether a fire was intentional, a case of arson (design), or just an accident. Cryptologists have procedures to determine whether a set of symbols is a secret message (design) or merely a random sequence. The point is that many branches of science already deal with the detection of design. The claim of design theory is that it can be applied to nature as well.

It would also point out that if you don't like it don't do business with companies like that. And private land is NOT an island unto itself. You go there to shop. There is no implicit agreement that a private store has the right to do that. You purchased your goods. Unless they suspect you stole something and have more than "its standard" they can't. I am fairly Libertarian on a lot of issues and I don't see how "private land" == "owner of the land can do what they want to you" is true. Its a business. When you open your doors to ANYONE you give up a lot of rights. However if I were a club member of something like SAMS Club thats fine. Me and Sams have an agreement that either of us can cancel.
I think a lot of these are good points to remember, but I must ask, what is  number seven saying?
"Sedulously eschew obfuscatory hyperverbosity or prolixity."
Also, is it just me or are numbers 20 and 23 the same.
http://www.pearceyreport.com/archives/2006/01/post_50.php

&gt;DESIGN: The hallmark of design is an irregular sequence that fits a prescribed pattern. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, the letters are irregular (they do not repeat the same pattern over and over, as in the SCRABBLE example). The reason they function to communicate is that they fit the prescribed pattern of the English language. The technical term for this is "specified complexity," and it's the kind of order we see in books, magazines, and Scrabble games.
&gt;
&gt;The most popular analogy, however, is a computer -- the DNA molecule itself is the hardware and the message it stores and conveys is the software. That's why biologist Richard Dawkins can say, "The machine code of the genes is uncannily computer-like. Apart from differences in jargon, the pages of a molecular biology journal might be interchanged with those of a computer engineering journal."
I'd forgotten perhaps the best one of all:
"Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour."
Well, that might be a little bleak ;)

On the long term, networks will improve and bandwidth will become cheaper. However, on the short-to-mid term the investments required to upgrade the networks might turn out to have a negative effect on the bandwidth price.

Bandwidth usage will probably increase as well, so supply and demand might well be in a similar situation as today, though.
My prefs hide items that have less than 10 points.  The original post just didn't reach critical mass.  Probably because the previous title is boring.

And I stopped playing Falling sand for this? The article is from 1982!
I didn't view the article so much as a "blanket argument" as a handful of complaints about PHP.  Maybe they're not all valid, and maybe they're not all compelling, but it's food for thought nonetheless.  It was a mistake for me to title the link simply "PHP Sucks" and not "I'm Sorry, but PHP Sucks," though; sorry to be misleading.

I work extensively with PHP and I think it's a great tool.  There are lots of jobs that I would rather do in PHP than any other language, although that's largely due to familiarity.  My general impression of PHP is that it has a good API, great community support, and it's very easy to learn.  I also happen to think that it's a fairly specialised tool that is really only good for the domain of problems that it was designed to solve.

Why do you even need an engagement ring? If I'm correct that's one of those modern things that they convinced everyone to buy.
I thought it was more about a living person's regrets over his mistreatment of someone who is now dead.  It wasn't really about the feelings you might have if *you* die having wasted your life, but rather the feelings you might have if someone around you dies, and you never took the chance to know them.

Actually he's right. 

The point is, that while you can reduce the consumption of oil, you can't decide what oil will no longer be consumed or  what the oil-producers no longer spend money on.

If less oil is consumed the oil no longer used will be the oil that is most expensive to pump. And that just doesn't happen to be oil from Saudi-Arabia. Now admittedly the Saudis are pumping at maximum capacity, so if the price goes down they, too, will make slightly less money. But that doesn't meen they will give less to terrorists but rather to the thing least important to them they are still spending on. That would more likely be a school for girls then al kaida. 

So if less money is spent on oil that doesn't mean less money finds it way to the terrorists. It means first less money for the marginal producer and second less money for whatever pleasure the Saudi royal family considers marginal.

So you can use less oil, but not less of the oil the al Sauds use to fund Osama.
there is no "real value" of anything.  it's all about how much people are willing to pay.

I do tonnes of PHP development and I enjoy the language.  However, I would be thrilled to learn another language that could do the same thing but faster and easier.

I have done a fair bit of research to find that elusive language, but I have yet to find anything that has really convinced me it fits the bill.

The reason PHP is so good is because it gets the job done.  And I know that when I need to work on a project on someone's crappy $9.95/month hosting server where I don't have shell access, can't compile binaries, and does not have Ruby installed, PHP will work.

Believe it or not I develop some pretty indepth projects that use AJAX and access some pretty hefty databases and I don't even know what cgi is all about.  It wasn't until a month ago that I realized that I am basically a LAMP developer.  Except I don't know much about Linux and I don't even know what Apache really is.

But the fact is if you know MySQL and PHP, Linux and Apache will take care of the rest of it.

Enlighten me if you think I'm a crackpot.
あとは当日か。
Aww, crap...  Ian Malcolm was right.
PHP is one of this languages in the big family of what Paul Graham calls "blub". The strength of PHP is that they got right before the others
not the language design, but the idea of having a lot of tools for
web programming well integrated with apache in just one tool.
Now it's too late, we'll have to live with it for a lot of years.
What's sad is that after the success PHP didnt' tried to follow a path
in order to fix what's wrong about its design.
Mod this guy up. Fundamental to the discussion of markets is the observation that something is worth what people will pay for it. Nothing else.
Does anyone else here 'let forever be' by the chemical brothers in there?
&gt; If I'm correct that's one of those modern things

Only if you count 1215 as modern.

"The inception of the engagement ring itself can be tied to the Fourth Lateran Council presided over by Pope Innocent III in 1215."

Basically the only thing that would beat out the earrings would be bigger diamonds, or in my wife's case a perhaps even more ridiculously priced item, a Chanel bag.

Thanks for the link.

One rubric of the ID crowd is that randomness can't result in anything that "appears" to be designed.  Here's a typical statement ...

"To convince a reasonable person otherwise requires a lot of evidence about the power of random, purposeless processes to create useful machines."

And another example, the one I was lambasting in the paragraph quoted above ...

"Naturalistic evolution is the antithesis to engineering. Engineers understand that complex structures are intelligently designed, not the product of random variations."

Purposeless random process do produce interesting things, e.g. mineral crystals, snowflakes, that might appear to some eyes to be "intelligently designed".  

But purposeful random processes are more interesting.  In biology, the purpose is propagation.  Those genes, haplotypes, species, etc., that are better at propagation, given the constraints of the biologica system, tend to be more successful.  A combination of random variations and natural selection produce results that to some eyes look like design.

In the breeding of canines, one can see the result of variations (different matings of dogs and bitches) combined with artificial selection according to a fitness criteria determined by the breeder (which quite apparently can be very different from natural selection criteria).

This process of random variations with fitness selection is an engineer design practice that has emerged over the last 30 years, and it's a pretty clever one.  Once a design reaches a certain complexity, it's time to let the machines take over.  

Since machines are powerful, but not intelligent, a different approach is taken.  Let the machine make all sorts of random guesses about how to implement something, and then test those candidate implementations against fitness criteria, also knowns as "design contraints".

In electronic circuit design, the design generation machine is typically computer HW and SW.  The constraints are based on arbitrary design contraints set by a designer.  In biology, the design generation machine is DNA.  The constraints are based on survival and propagation within a biological system.  What differentiates DNA from computer HW is the ability to reproduce.

For more on the topic of how evolutionary theory informs modern design practices ...

Found this interesting.
I hate to give details especially my phone number to other companies.

Well, he didn't really mistreat the guy, he just didn't get to know him. You simply can't feel bad about not getting to know everybody you meet, and I don't really think the author does. He only felt bad about it after the guy dies and he finds out that he didn't have any friends ("no one cared"). He feels sorry for the guy because he thinks the guy had no life, not so much because he mistreated him. My only real point is that feeling sorry for the guy after he's dead is kind of a waste, and the only real effect is to create a sense of "I don't want to be like that," which doesn't seem very logical either, at least not to me.
One reason that they hate us is that we keep messing with their countries as the US government attempts to guarantee oil supply for our economy.  The history of the US's relationship with Iran is fascinating that way, and The World had a [good series](http://theworld.org/worldfeature/iran/index.shtml) on it.

So once we stop depending on their oil, maybe we'll stop propping up corrupt governments (e.g. Hussein in the 80s), and eventually good will might return.
I agree completely, people do have incentives to promote the languages they use, but that's not what this article is doing.  Just look at the title.

Consider spoken languages.  I may just use English and a little bit of Spanish because I live in New Mexico, but that doesn't mean I should go around saying "French sucks!" just because I don't like the way French words are pronounced, or saying "Chinese sucks!" because I don't understand what all those intricate symbols mean.  Each on has its uses and appropriate times to use it (like when in New Mexico, France or China).

Apparently if the US were to impose a $2 gas tax, consumption would immediately drop by 15%. After a few years, consumption would be expected to drop by 60%. So apparently oil consumption is not too inelastic to be influenced by price. (Unfortunately I don't recall the source of these numbers...I think it was an article linked from reddit.)

I dunno. I like a woman who knows how to preen herself, but a single pair of earrings the cost of a new Macbook Pro?

There's a line where extravagant becomes absurd. I'm not sure I'd want a woman with tastes that expensive. Not for a wife, anyways.
And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before its data banks had been connected up it had started from "I think therefore I am" and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off.
Actually fundamental to the discussion is an understanding of the nature of the diamond market. It is a monopoly with a single organization throttling the supply of diamonds in the world. The reason that diamonds deviate hugely from their "real value" is because there are no competitors to DeBeers.
But otherwise, in most other areas where there is healthy competition, the prices of items are close to their real values.
It sounds like Scott Adams missed the first day of Economics class, where they discussed supply and demand.

When you buy a car with better mileage, you do your part to reduce demand for oil. Reducing demand means (a) less oil gets sold and (b) it gets sold for a cheaper price.

So it does have some small effect on oil producers' profits, and if a large number of people do it, the effect could be dramatic.
That's why it should be separate.  It's not convenient to have that page cluttered with subreddits that most people can't read.
&gt; the prices of items are close to their real values.

You don't get it do you. There's no "real value" of anything. Humans place a value on something by deciding how much to pay for it, and whether to buy it or not. This is not a defence of DeBeer's questionable tactics - just a fundamental economic principle.

Ahh the ellegance in simplicity
Ever since I read the '[Diamond Maker](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/456)' (HG Wells) I have tended to discount the idea of 'no competitors to [DeBeers](http://www.debeers.com/)'. Since the fall of the Russian empire of the eighties, stories of synthetic diamonds have been filtering out.  Now while the Sweeds have created [synthetic diamonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_diamond) since the '50's - it has only recently become a threat to natural diamonds as Russian crafted synthetic diamonds of gem quality have permiated the market. The technical details are [here](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/diamond_pr.html).

So much so that DeBeers have spent [considerable effort](http://www.debeers.com/about_crafted.php) branding and [authetication](http://www.debeers.com/about_beauty_scan.php) of diamonds. You could almost add another C to the *4C's*....

You're not a crackpot, although I think that "...when I need to work on a project on someone's crappy $9.95/month hosting server where I don't have shell access, can't compile binaries, and does not have Ruby installed, PHP will work." is probably the heart of it. PHP has good characteristics for mass use, and it got there at the right time. It isn't a language I would pick to build complex sites in if I didn't have to, though.
I would imagine that significant use of runtime evaluation is not good for performance, either.

It seems natural to me that clicking on the title should take you to the subreddit your in, that was how I expected it to work before it did work that way, but it is annoying that there's no link to click back to the main reddit page. 

I don't think changing the behaviour would work either, if the title says "features reddit", then it should take me to the features reddit. Maybe a link home could be added near the top of the page, by the logo or by my username.
It's called a documented source... "so and so said" is not a source. I learned in 10th grade journalism to have a little more than BS to write a story... oh, and then to finish it with an editorial opinion "Cheney's reckless and drunken actions can't talk to the public then any evidence that shows the Vice President drunk as a skunk will never see the light of day." That's called yellow journalism. 

Also, one beer at noon, drunk at dusk........? Does not sound plausible no matter what heart drugs you are taking. A beer's OH- content lasts an hour max... not 5+ hrs with physical activity. Oh, but wait, Cheney had a DUI when he was a teen, 50 yrs. ago, he must be always drunk. 

Also, from what I read, it was the police who decided not to go to the ranch until the next morning. Imagine, you shoot your good friend, are freaking out... go to the hospital (which always takes forever, even if you are the VP of the US) and are dealing with contacting his family, waiting for news etc... It wasn't like he went back to the ranch, kicked up his feet and just brushed off the cops until the morning.

The media has gone nuts with this and shown us how ridiculous they can be... it's important to question your elected officials, but it's also important to question the media and realize when they've gone too far.
From the link that you posted:

In neoclassical economics, the value of an object or service is often seen as nothing but the price it would bring in an open and competitive market. This is determined primarily by the demand for the object relative to supply.

That is the notion of value that I subscribe to as well. Thanks for the link!

&lt;i&gt;
it has only recently become a threat to natural diamonds as Russian crafted synthetic diamonds of gem quality have permiated the market.
&lt;/i&gt;

My point precisely.. So it does seem like there were no real competitors to DeBeers until recently.
Does this strike anyone else as expectable from this administration?  "Stop shoving the Constitution in my face!  It's just a goddamn piece of paper!"  Those words may or may not have actually come out of Bush's mouth, but he lives by them every day.
So we are in agreement then? Diamonds have no "real value" other than what people will pay for them.
I think their aim is to have each subreddit represent a smaller community, instead of a level of organization. 

That could work out well for language subreddits, and maybe for certain topics (like the "Developers" one mentioned in the reddit blog), but maybe not for others (like the winter olympics).
I had seen the documentary about the synthetic diamonds being produced cheaply in Russia. Apparently, the synthetic diamonds were more flawless than natural diamonds. As per the documentary, the DeBeers spin machine was busy trying  to prove to people that the flaws were a sign of it being natural and therefore a desirable attribute for a diamond.. LOL

I am neither in agreement nor disagreement. :-) My point was just that if the market were competitive then the price of diamonds would be closer to the "value" as per the definition that I quoted.

IMHO, your definition of "value", i.e., what people will pay for them, is more appropriate in the field of something like say the art industry. Not all rare paintings are expensive. But only those painters that people take a "fancy" to are  expensive. But even in such a situation, if Van Gogh were able to paint a million paintings in his lifetime, the price  for such paintings would be drastically lower than if they were rarer to obtain.
http://reddit.com/goto?id=24918
Nobody is being fooled. Nobody disputes that its value on the street far exceeds it true rarity. The point is that the value is not inherent in the item itself, but rather placed upon it. People were being fooled if they invested in a diamond ring thinking it would turn out to be some grand return later in life, when fact is that far more are held onto by their owners into death than pawned or sold. 

Yeah it would be nice if things didn't work like this, but it's been the practice for numerous years. It's a modern dowry, in a sense and that's been SOP for a hell of a long time. It's simply a physical adjunct to an entirely abstract idea. I don't see the commotion.

yea, wtf is the story??
I find some of these reasons quite comical.

&gt; 1. There are 3 incompatible versions of PHP.

Spoken as if your webserver runs all 3 of them at the same time.  Just about any language that has more than one version does something in a later version that breaks some things that would work in a previous version.

&gt; 2. PHP’s character-set support is so bad, I want to scratch my eyes out

This is true, but few people have need to parse a non-standard character set.  Additionally, lots of emerging  web technologies had poor character set support until they realized that people who used other character sets would want to use their software, most famously MySQL.

&gt; 3. #  (string)"false" == (int)0 is true

Double equals will ALWAYS try to convert the comparison to like types.  It works quite logically to me.

&gt; 4. References are syntactically complex and implemented, let’s be nice, “badly” (PHP 5 solves some of this with a incompatible change)

He complains it should work better.  Then complains that in fixing it in PHP 5, that it breaks what he said works badly in the first place.

&gt; 5. PHP isn’t thread-safe

He provides a perfectly reasonable work-around in the text of the reply.

&gt; 6. The quality of PHP’s compiled-in libraries differs widely

Ok, that means that there are some good libraries.  In my experience there are many.

The whole article is just a rant as to how PHP sucked for his particular project coded in his particular style, with the final assumption that it must be useless for everyone.

One has to remember PHP is the youngest of the popular scripting languages.  PHP 3 was the first widely received public release in 1998 and really the Zend Engine (the backend) didn't hit 1.0 until PHP 4 was released in 2000.  For comparison, Python was 1.0 in the early 90s, and Perl was 1.0 in 1987.

It is certainly improving with each new releases, and will continue to get better.

To add my personal arguement, the C/C++ syntax makes it great.  You can switch between C/C++, Java, and PHP while still maintaining syntactic sanity and it's not difficult for many current programmers to learn or decypher a program written in it.

*People were being fooled if they invested in a diamond ring thinking it would turn out to be some grand return later in life, when fact is that far more are held onto by their owners into death than pawned or sold*

Even if you conceded that tons of diamond engagement rings end up in pawn shops due to break-ups and aren't all worn for a lifetime doesn't diminish the force of your argument at all just because those pawned diamonds don't have any value compared to when they were new.  I'd rather not assume that a pawned diamond indicates somebody was "fooled"...it's the law of diminishing returns at work.  Rings are sentimental, personal gifts and once the relationship ends people may not want to be reminded of the person the ring was meant to signify.  

That doesn't mean the same guy who pawned a ring wouldn't turn around and buy a new diamond for a new girlfriend 2 years later.  It's not a matter of learning a lesson but rather deciding that the value of the ring, no matter what your view of the economics of the situation are, is worth spending a lot of money on.

If you want to pick up a good quality, cheap diamond, look at pawn shops near military bases, the closer, the better.  But I wouldn't advise telling your beloved that you bought her ring at a pawn broker any more than I would advise telling her that the Chanel bag you found for her came from a thrift store that didn't know any better.  The value of the item proceeds from its symbolic meaning linked to one woman and the *perception* that diamonds are rare, and if hundreds of thousands of men in Western countries spend large amounts of cash on squashed carbon that they KNOW they've been culturally conditioned to buy, the monetary value of the item rises according to those market forces anyway.

I know some women who don't care where the diamond came from.  But other women consider that a diamond can only be given once, else the symbiosis will be meaningless to them, even women who drive used cars or wear thrift store clothing.  I admit it's bizarre, but who here can really say that they understand women anyway?
Correct. Bin Laden is our Emmanuel Goldstein.

I dislike Bush as much as the next guy, but this site seems a fraud.  It's a bad sign that these articles get so many points on reddit.  

But I suppose there is a silver lining to this.  When crap stories get printed or broadcast in the regular media, you don't know what percentage of the audience believe them. On reddit, thanks to points, we actually get a precise index of the credulity of the audience.  Articles like these function like the control in a controlled experiment.  What they indicate, at the moment, is that about a quarter of the points of any juicy anti-Bush story come from people voting with their brains turned off.  Could be worse...
While I'm glad to see this - too many abortions are done purely out of convenience, I'm pretty baffled with there not being an exception for rape victims.

Is there an exception for cases where its either the mother or the child that dies?

Anyway, people are free to have their own opinions, but when people are having abortions simply because they don't want the child or they don't have the money, there is no excuse. You really should've thought of that before you decided to start practicing a human action which has the side-effect of producing human beings.

This day and age, there's plenty of people on adoption waiting lists that would gladly take your baby. There just is no excuse for killing a child purely out of convenience.

Still, there does need to be some type of exception for both rape victims and in cases where the mother can die. In that case I don't think you can really give a black and white answer, and it comes down to the situation at hand.
Yeesh.
awesome. Its like attending 2 good universities... at the same time.

Now I have yet another reason to ignore my actual college courses....
&gt; Nobody is being fooled. Nobody disputes that its value on the street far exceeds it true rarity.

Nobody disputes it, but almost nobody knows it either. If everyone knew how common natural diamonds were, demand would fall. Just like the chimp who won't take good food as a reward when he sees that you've got better food to share. Many people would feel cheated by the prices charged.

interesting prediction.
interesting proposition
If you oppose abortion, it's presumably because you are of the opinion that abortion is murder. If it’s murder, how can you possibly justify killing a human being just because his or her father committed a criminal act?

What if that child were brought to term, was born, and developed into an adult. Would it be okay to kill him at 30 years of age? If not, how can you advocate killing him in utero and still unhypocritically claim that a fetus is a human being?
South Dakota is too small, and abortion would be too available in neighbor states, to have any measurable impact IMHO.
But Diamonds *are* rare. DeBeers sees to it that they are.
&gt; IMHO, your definition of "value", i.e., what people will pay for them

This isn't *my* definition - it's Economics' definition.
Right, what I'm about to say is based on a Slashdot comment  on a comparable newsitem, but the guy had a good point:

Companies that get caught trying to scam the patent office in a way such as this, should get a hefty, _hefty_ fine, and be denied the right to file patents for a certain duration of time (several years, at least).
Ugh. We're so fucked. America is turning itself into Hell.

If you don't care what other people do for their "convenience" and you'd like to soften the impact of this and other restrictions on women's access to abortions, you may wish to consider mailing a check to the **[New York Abortion Access Fund](http://www.nyaaf.org/)**. Many of the women affected by this legislation may wind up in New York.

Women too poor to travel are the ones that will really suffer. WTG, culture warriors.

How brilliant is that!?

&gt; This day and age, there's plenty of people on adoption waiting lists that would gladly take your baby.

According to the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth, in the US there are an estimated 3.3 adoption seekers for every actual adoption, and roughly 100,000 adoptions.  However, more than half of those are by step-parents.  So "real" adoptions are only about 50,000.  Contrast this with 1.4 *million* abortions.  

I find abortion repugnant, but if you're going to argue the pro-life side, at least don't make obviously false claims.

I find the phrase 'purely out of convenience' outrageous and insulting.  I take it you're a guy ... and not a parent.  The responsibility of properly raising a child is enormous, and the fear of being a crappy parent can be overwhelming -- *even if you are married, have a job and a house,* and such.  It's easy to reach the conclusion that an abortion is better than dooming a kid to a life with crappy parents.

Because some anti-choice people have some humanity and can see how grotesque it is for us to prohibit abortion for rape victims. They can't connect the rest of the dots because they don't see a problem with the govenment restricting women's control over their bodies in general. Their identification with abortion seekers **[only goes so far](http://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/anti-tales.html)**.

Whether it's "murder" has nothing to do with it. Whether you call abortion "murder" just depends on how you define the word. We all know what everyone else thinks a fetus/human-life/unborn-baby is. We all know what everyone else thinks murder/justifiable-homicide/medical-procedure is. A rose by any other name.

It's not the control of women's bodies we want, it's the "control" over the unborn child that we care about. In other words we don't think it's right that a women should be allowed to kill her unborn child. Just like it's not right to kill a baby once it's born.

This whole discussion is kind of missing the point. Yes, value is determined by humans. But in most markets, it's also determined by how easy it is to get. As noted in the link, the value is the price it would bring in an *open and competitive* market. In an open and competitive market, diamonds would not bring a very high price, because they're very cheap to find and turn into jewels, and so competitors would undercut one another until they'd reached a price proportional to the cost of manufacture. This, I think, is what the other posters are intuitively thinking of when they say "real value." The reason that diamonds are so expensive is not that they're difficult to make or find, but because De Beers has closed the market to competition in this way that they cannot be undercut. 

And that's what's illegitimate about the whole operation, which is what elicits distaste from readers; De Beers mainly makes money not by providing a desired product, but by closing the market to competition.

The question is larger than South Dakota having the ability to bar abortions (though it ironically comes back to the respective states ability to do so). 

Roe vs. Wade, a name most Americans are familiar with, was a 1973 case where a majority of the US Supreme Court held individual states can't write laws preventing abortion. Since then, the folks on the "pro-life" side have attempted to challenge it every so often, for the Supreme Court has reversed itself in the past. It now has 2 new conservative members (a net gain of +1).

Inevitably, the South Dakota statute will be challenged in court before it goes into effect. The "big deal" of it will be whether it makes its way up to the Supreme court, who, with its new composition, may possibly overturn the earlier *Roe* decision.

This is unlikely, since the court was sitting at 6-3 against overturn, and will now probably still be one short at 5-4. If, for some reason, it is overturned, the states will likely have the ability to make their own abortion laws, and the (literally) poor girls who get knocked up in the wrong state will be getting dangerous procedures in back alleys again. So there could be a measurable impact.

The story asserts that they have a quantum computer that works by sending a photon along paths that will be different for different "runs", except that because of mumble-mumble quantum effects, it all happens in one run, and the probabilities associated with the effects along the various paths are how the answer is arrived at.  This, believe it or not, is the simple, straightforward part.

The new result, apparently, is that they can prevent the photon from entering the multi-pathed layout at all, and get the same answer (because, apparently, there's some probability that it got in there anyway, I guess).  So the computer doesn't actually operate, in that there's no photon supplied to it.  

Of course, since they get the desired result, the computer does operate, in a sense.  

I am not a physicist of any kind, and have only read various popular accounts of quantum computers, so this might be all wrong.

As of me reading this, there are 32 comments and not a single mention of the word "sex". So be it: overpaying for a diamond is, more often than not, actually paying for the right to have sex with a specific woman. The value of *that* may very well be higher than the intrinsic value of the diamond (whatever the semantics). Being happily married for 13 years, I hereby declare that diamonds are for... other people.

Apparently, back when God created man, he not only made sex outside of marriage possible, but he also gave women a sex drive so that some of them actually *wanted* to have sex, and didn't need a marriage proposal to persuade them.  I know, I didn't believe it at first either, but I read it on the internet somewhere, so it must be true.

Of course, it goes without saying that God'll strike down any woman who lets a man touch her before he's given her a diamond ring.  I mean, that's just common sense.

No there's this pure PHP templating system called PHPSavant.  Having used Spring WebMVC and TurboGears in the meantime I can say this package does a fine job separating view from controller, and without having to add any "barftastic" special syntax to the PHP template, considering, as you say, it already is a templating language.  After you put variables into the template's namespace using the "$tpl-&gt;assign()" method, they are available in the template using the standard object dereferencing prefix "$this-&gt;"

That being said almost nobody in the PHP community uses PHPSavant.  Another reason why PHP sucks: the community prefers the worst kind of hacks rather than elegant solutions that mirror the best of what's going on with other languages.
They missed out tetris, though :(

Here's a thing about reddit that I don't really understand: The “story” whose comments you're now reading has already been posted a few days ago: http://reddit.com/info?id=1x9z and didn't do too well (-1 points as of this writing). This post now has 18 points.  
Is it really just the title that does all the difference? Or was the other one posted at the wrong moment?
I found the co-operation of WoW to be crap. There is no in game default voice chat feature. Thus you can only communicate via typing. If you're typing you can't do anything else. So you can't communicate well with other players. In WoW co-operating is limited to not being a dick. People don't play an instance dungeon together, in reality a group of people play beside each other and don't intentionally screw each other over. That's not co-operation.

It all comes down to this:  Does the recomendation engine work on keywords or by matching you up with other people like you??  I feel like I'm asking this question every day and never getting a definitive answer.
I think the beat is, as you say fairly simple, but the sound of it is unique.
I know that several people have tried to replicate it, and definitely did not succeed.
Duh.
So if, after a few more times, you finally don't want to do it again then you must have had good sex, right?

Just out of curiosity, do you agree with prostitution? I do, but I'm finding it difficult to spot where the distinction is. Maybe it's due to the permanence of sterility compared with the temporary relief of cash.

In other words, in preferences people should be able to set whether 1 downvote = 1, 0.5, 0.25, or even 0.

**This would cater to those who want downvote values reduced (sort of), as well as those that want to be able to ignore the impact of downvoting altogether.**

While I agree that my ideal mate is an extrovert, I don't agree that Opposites always attract.  I dated a girl who was my complete opposite on the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator and while she was fun at times, and generally a sweet girl, she drove me crazy by the end of it.

So for some traits, being with your opposite is ideal, but not all of them.

The arguments this guy makes are ludicruous. People who enjoy the 'album experience' are still likely to purchase an entire album. However, his accusation that iTunes makes music disposable is unbelievably hypocritical, when you consider that major record labels now focus almost completely on producing short-term disposable artists. Is it any wonder that many consumers only buy singles on iTunes when the recording industry has largely neglected the 'album experience' for the last decade?

The idea of comparing the output of the latest manufactured "Pop Idol" to Pablo Picasso is hilarious:
&gt; The artist went into the studio and created a body of work. If you were buying a painting from Picasso, would you have said, "Look Pablo. I like this painting man. But I only like that corner part with the tree and the guy's finger. How about you chop off that corner and I give you $1 instead of $10 for the painting? '

A more apt comparison would be:
&gt; Studio to Artist: Look Picasso, you've produced two good paintings. However, your contract requires that you now paint ten more quick knock-offs to fill the walls of this gallery so that we can charge our customers more.

Script kiddie. Give *no* information on what vulnerbility it uses. This is not white hat stuff.
not to sound like a cynic -- but there are real world answers to these questions -- not least of which is the national (U.S.) situation with healthcare. 

i have a wife and daughter and i'm the sole income.  while my job may not be the most fulfilling aspect of my day, it does provide me with a healthcare plan and a level of stability i feel comfortable with.  we've talked about me moving on to something more fulfilling; however, the issue of healthcare is always the stopper.  right now my company pays 16K annually to cover me and mine -- and they get a discount that an individual seeking coverage would not get.

i actually am curious to hear from anyone else on this issue --- if you've 'broken away' from the corporate world, how are you handling healthcare?  are you paying for it yourself ?  are you going without?


If you actually read the patent, you can see that the author of this main article really did not read the patent.  The patent itself mentions FLASH, Java and other rich media.  He has not been granted an article on rich-media.  He basically wants to CREATE FLASH content via a web system instead of using a FLASH builder on your own computer:

Here is a quote from the patent: "Rich-media productions are programmed and edited using powerful and complex tools designed for this purpose. Such productions are a recent phenomenon to the Internet and have only been made possible by the introduction of multimedia tools and technologies for the creation of high-production Internet content. None of these multimedia tools and technologies, however, allows for the creation of rich-media applications via the Internet."

If you go to this website listed in the comment, you can see that the patent owner is just trying to CREATE Flash content via the web - not using software on your computer.  So, this article is very inaccurate.

Stop the hype, demote this article.

Ok Peter Norvig posts there. I'm sold.
Is anyone still trying to argue that patents are necessary to induce people to innovate?  They basically allow companies to sit on their laurels once they get a patent, instead of constantly competing to get ahead.  Being first to market is already incentive enough.

There's nothing stopping inventors from working for companies just like programmers do.  And can you imagine how much money gets wasted dealing with patents, which could be avoided if they didn't exist?
come on, `Road Trip` and `Harold and Kumar Go to Whitecastle` were fine movies.

Decent tips though.
It's not necessary to quit your day-job to do something you love.  So long as you can keep reasonable limits on what you do for a living (e.g. 9am-5pm and them I'm out of here), that still leaves you 4-6 hours every day to do other stuff.  I'm sure that for most people, the key to doing what they love is not chucking in a well-paid job, it's just watching less TV.

Üdvözlöm a kedves honfitársakat.

Úgy gondoltam érdemes lenne pár szót írni a Redditrõl és annak használatáról mivel még nincsenek lefordítva a gombok és linkek magyarra.

------------------------------------------------------

**Mi a Reddit?**

A Reddit egy olyan honlap ahol a regisztrált látogatók...

 1. mindenféle érdekes lapokat adnak be.
 2. a beadványokat megtekinthetik, és fel- vagy leszavazhatják õket.
 3. a beadványok "comment" (hozzászólás) oldalán megvitathatják a beadvány tartalmát más látogatókkal.

------------------------------------------------------

**Mi kell a regisztrációhoz?**

Semmi.

Nem kér jelenleg a Reddit email címet.  Csak kattintani ki kell választani hogy "Register", és megadni egy "Username"-t (felhasználói nevet) meg egy "Password"-öt (jelszót).

------------------------------------------------------

**Mit ér a felszavazás / leszavazás?**

A felfelé mutató nyilacskával történõ felszavazás növeli egy beadvány vagy hozzászólás pontszámát, míg a lefelé mutató nyilacskával történõ leszavazás csökkenti a pontszámot.

E tevékenységeknek három fõ hatása van:

  1. A beadvány / hozzászólás a lapon magasabbra vagy alacsonyabbra kerül ahogy a pontszáma megváltozik a többi laphoz / hozzászóláshoz képest.
  2. A beadó vagy hozzászólás író "karmája" javul vagy romlik.  A karma alapjában a felhasználó neve mellett megjelenõ zárójelbeli pontszám.  Ennek a hatása nem ismert (s lehet nem-létezõ) de büszkeség tárgyává tud válni, ha jó.
  3. A Reddit "megtanulja" hogy milyen beadványok tetszenek az adott felhasználónak, és milyen beadványok nem tetszenek.  Ez alapján a **recommend** lapon ajánlani tud további érdekességeket amik valószínûleg elnyerik a felhasználó tetszését.

------------------------------------------------------

**Mi az a "hot", "new", "top", "recommended", meg "saved"?**

 * **hot**: ezen a lapon az úgymond "forró" avagy nagyon aktív beadványok jelennek meg, csökkenõ "forrósági" sorrendben.  A "forróság" összetevõi a felfelé szavazás és a hozzászólások.  Minnél több van mind a kettõbõl annál "forróbb" az adott beadvány.
 * **new**: ezen a lapon a legfrissebb beadványok jelennek meg.  Mivel a **hot** lapon csak a már valamelyest felszavazott beadványok láthatóak, érdemes idõrõl idõre megnézni a **new** lapot, hogy új és érdekes beadványokat felszavazhassunk.
 * **top**: ezen a lapon minden idõk legmagasabb pontszámú beadványai jelennek meg, csokkenõ pontszámi sorrendben.
 * **recommended**: ezen a lapon olyan beadványok jelennek meg amik a Reddit szerint tetszeni fognak a felhasználónak.  Azt hogy mi is tetszhet a felhasználónak úgy tanulja a Reddit hogy figyelemmel követi a felhasználó fel- és leszavazásait.  (Friss regisztráció után eltarthat egy ideig míg eleget szavaz a felhasználó hogy a Redditt tudjon beadványt ajánlani.  Ameddig ez nem történt meg, addig a **recommend** lap üres marad.)
 * **saved**: ezen a lapon a felhasználó által elmentett beadványok láthatók.  Minden beadvány alatt van egy "save" (elmentés) hivatkozás.  Ha erre kattint, az a **saved** lapba menti az adott beadványt.

------------------------------------------------------

További kellemes Redditezést!

Good idea, closing down the company if it does nothing but filing patents would also be a good idea.

I don't want a browser that loads faster, I want a browser that is responsive and on that count Firefox failed miserably compared to Opera every time I tried it (about once every two months or so in the past).
While I applaud the ideal of ceasing to work at a job you dislike and doing something you love, even if it's a crazy idea, this author seems to think everyone who works in a "soulless cubicle" is just unhappily toiling away for the Man(tm), working hard to earn a salary for no good reason. Well it's just not true - some of my friends are absolutely happy doing what they do day in, day out, working in a cubicle, and yes they're earning high salaries for it. And I like to think those salaries are a result of truly loving what they do and working hard because they love it, not because they're chasing a check. That, however, seems to escape this author. Apparently everyone who works in an office and dons a grey flannel tuxedo every morning is a mindless corporate drone who needs to be woken up and escaped from their nightmare. It's warmed-over Matrix philosophizing - which aptly explains why it's in a dinky rag like SF Gate.
Wow, a company uses advertising to sway people to buy something they don't need? Fascinating concept!

I think he may have been making a point related to copying.  The whole point of this presentation was to show the downsides of intellectual property copyright laws.  This presentation was originally recorded on vinyl, and the vinyl recording was used in order to create the video -- something that couldn't be legally done if there was a copyright on the vinyl.  I thought it provided for an interesting effect.
I've always thought that it would be awesome for a video rental place to have a kiosk for surfing RottenTomatoes and IMDb.

I know reviews aren't the be-all and end-all of movie evaluation, but I'd feel much more confident renting if I could actually read some advance reviews. (I know the fear is that it would hurt sales, but has review disclosure been a problem for Amazon? No.)

this would be a great feature since comments have become a central part of reddit.

It can be added two ways.

1. Using the voting system in comments. My only issue with this is that instead of QOTW, it's more like highest scoring quote this week.

2. Using the old fashioned newsgroup system, devise a way to count +1 QOTW replies to comments. Would be technically a lot harder, but would really be better since an excerpt of a reply could be voted as the quote of the week.

Haven't you heard?  Reading reddit is the new staying-in-and-watching-a-movie-together.
No, he's right. Fake login screens are a big threat to sites like these. Ms is particularly vulnerable in that you can overwrite a whole profile page with your fake login (using a large position:fixed table for example. There are many ways.)

Alright here's one example. I'm missing a few parts here, but look it up if you want to know:

First you put something like:

     &lt;TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0
     STYLE="position:absolute;left:03;width:999;height:8000"
     bgcolor="e5e5e5"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

in the profile. This covers the whole page with a blank table. You'll have to go into `safe mode` to submit it. Once you reach the page were you confirm the profile change you'll see that the submit button is covered due to the automatic preview.

To fix this you'll have to save the html of the page to your comp. Then edit the source and look for the form's `&lt;form method="post" action="/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.processInterests&amp;Mytok...` Since the html page is now on your harddrive you'll have to make the action url an absolute address so the brower will know were to send the form data. To do this, just prepend a `http://editprofile.myspace.com` or whatever was in the URL of the page originally to the action target (thing in the quotes).

Now, to make it so you can see the submit button, just delete the `&lt;table..` stuff from the preview section in the file. A simple search should find it. But its in the file twice, be sure to remove the one that isn't in quotes (The one the browser will actually see.)

Open this page on your hd with your browser. Press submit.

There, you've overwritten your page with a large blank table that blends in pretty well. Inside the table is were you'd put your fake myspace login. Some copy and pasting from the real thing should get you something that looks very close to the original. Luckily ms allows you to put any old forms in your profile so you should be in business.

Since all this flexibility is a key factor in the site's success, I'd say that the vulnerability is simply the user's susceptibility to the fishing attack.
&gt; Work hard and the world respects you. Work hard and you can have anything you want. Work really extra super hard and do nothing else but work and ignore your family and spend 14 hours a day at the office and make 300 grand a year that you never have time to spend, sublimate your soul to the corporate machine and enjoy a profound drinking problem and sporadic impotence and a nice 8BR mini-mansion you never spend any time in, and you and your shiny BMW 740i will get into heaven.

The author of this article is preaching to the converted.  He's obviously trying to coax dedicated "jobbers" into taking the plunge and putting their personal happiness ahead of their careers.  Why bother?  If somebody is willing to give up their day job to do what they "really want," they're not going to decide to do it because of an article like this.  Similarly, I don't think this will ward off anybody who is about to start down the path of corporate serfdom.

This guy is right, but he's missing Blizzard's motivation: they're paid on a monthly subscription basis for WoW.

If you don't really get sucked into the community aspect, you are more likely to stop subscribing at some point sooner than you would otherwise. They need to make it easy to play with or around others, and hard to play against just the computer.

My guess would be that they believe their spam filter is up to the task. Considering the experience I have had with it I am inclined to agree. My guess is that they are going to use the contents of your web page to help improve the spam filtering for you. (in addition to letting them target ads that much better)

There's a checkbox in the options:

Pretty open-minded of Google, although there are kind of limited options since the homepage is linked to your account.
For my convenience, I'd like to off people like you who think it's OK to exterminate a certain class of humans because they are a nuisance.  This option should be available to me without state interference, because I don't really want to go to jail for murdering you at my leisure.

See how your logic works out?  Great, isn't it?
It's all about reading reddit in your own separate homes, then talking online about the articles you're reading.  That's how you *really* connect with someone.
"PARASIZ SAĞLIK GÜVENLİ YAŞAM İSTİYORUZ"
AKP hükümetinin İMF’ye verdiği sözler gereği uyguladığı sağlık ve sosyal güvenlik politikalarına yönelik tepkiler hızla artıyor. Sosyal kazanımları geri almayı hedefleyen bu saldırılara karşı ortak mücadele çağrısında bulunan Emek Platformu 19 Şubat 2006 Pazar günü Ankara’da bir miting düzenledi.

Saat 11.00'da Tren Garı önünde toplanan platform bileşenleri ile mitinge destek veren diğer sivil toplum örgütleri Sıhhiye Meydanına doğru yürüyüşe geçtiler. Binlerce kişinin toplandığı alanda sosyal güvenlik (SS) ve Genel Sağlık Sigortası (GSS) tasarıları protesto edildi. Sağlık hizmetlerinin parasız olmasını isteyen emekçiler “Sağlıkta ticaret ölümdür”, “AKP halka hesap verecek” gibi sloganlar attıktan sonra miting sona erdi.

I like 6360693 too. A stick to play fetch with. It can - crazy scientists these days - even be made of wood, if you so choose.
Assuming the law actually reduced the abortion rate in South Dakota, I think the crime rate would be lower.  After all, the state would be minus at least two or three hundred murders annually (I heard somewhere that the lone abortion clinic in South Dakota has about 400 abortions each year).
It's not them, it's the bulk of patents. The patent office only checks spelling, not prior technology, and leaves problems to be solved when things are challenged - and I believe most things that are challenged are indeed revoked.

But yes, patents are archaic things this day and age.
There should be no exception for rape victims, because it does not make sense to justify another crime to repair the crime which has already been done and is irreversible.

For situations where the mother's health is in danger, the only legally permissible action should be for the doctor to relocate the developing child to some place either inside the mother's body or outside the mother's body where it can continue its development with a reduced health impact to the mother.  And this should only be allowed when it is conclusive that mother would die if the child's development were not interfered with.

I understand that this usually results in the death of the child, as we have no real means to guarantee that a child can develop outside of a mother's body or even if it is to be relocated to another part of the mother's body.  However, we are talking about a tough decision where a doctor is usually deciding between one death and two deaths.  And, the child's death is an unintended double effect of the action to save the mother's life.

this is garbage. they try to sell a  book on internet security. It's like having an adware that sells anti-adware protection :)

I don't want to beat this subject to death, but I would like to think about 'what makes a community'.  It seems to me that a community like Developers is a topic-based community.  Maybe not, I don't know, but I suspect that most developers have interests that are a larger subset of the general public's interests than just programming and geekery (I know I do).

Comminities that can be identified by something other than topic make more sense to me.  Language, as we have seen.  I also suggested that perhaps geographic location might be valid.  There are probably other ways to define commuinities that aren't topic based too.
You could just turn on the preference "don't show sites after i've disliked them"

(err, it seems that this is a reddit.com-wide preference... it would be nice if these preferences could be unique to each subreddit...)

Uh, but you usually need a recovery period after masterbation, too.
It would be nice to be able to have different preferences for each subreddit.  For instance on the subreddits subreddit I'd like to be able to use "don't show sites after i've disliked them" but I don't want that on the main reddit.com page or any other subreddit.
i worked an office job, hated it, and decide to make a change.  now i'm an archaeologist despite the fact that everyone said i was crazy and would never get a job.  it wasn't hard.  as long as you dedicate yourself to something and really try without being afraid to fail, it'll usually work out, and if it doesn't at least you can say you made the effort.

On your page you ask "Are there any inherent dangers or exploits that can come from CSS?" and the answer is yes.

Internet Explorer, at least, can be made to run javascript included in CSS. This was the vector for the myspace [samy is my hero worm](http://fast.info/myspace/)
That's a problem with the user-agent, not with the spec. There's nothing insecure about CSS itself. Javascript, on the other hand...

There's plenty insecure with css. If any form elements are allowed, it could be used to easily place a realistic looking fake login on a page that sends your passwords straight to the attacker.

I am pretty tired of this article being "recycled" over and over and over.  Its been proven wrong by experts in the field many times.  Its ridiculous, filled with half truths, and speaks of inefficiences that are hard to fathom.
That's freaking amazing.
The author is making an imaginary distinction. He presupposes incorrectly that life consists of one big choice: work one's ass off in stable boring dumb job in cubicle for money, or not work very hard (or not very disciplinedly) in unstable interesting job outside cubicle for uncertain money. This is not what happens in real life. In real life, the market demands many, many services that do not involve sitting in cubicles. Many of these probably pay more, for a mildly enterprising, mildly talented individual who is willing to work his or her ass off, than cubicle jobs do.
Almost as inspirational as the man himself.

This is a cop-out used by people who don't understand programming languages and their different features to avoid the problem of language design completely. Some languages are better than others. You must, must, must agree that no one should ever code in Brainfuck for anything that's going to be useful to anyone. This is an existence theorem for a language being bad. 

It is bad to use Brainfuck because brainfuck lacks major features that are needed to aid linguistic abstraction. This is why no one uses it; literally everyone who knows how to program has used a language more powerful than Brainfuck, and so they look at Brainfuck and say "How could you ever get anything done? You don't have &lt;feature&gt;." where &lt;feature is usually named variables or something like that. 

There is no reason whatsoever that this argument does not apply to other more widely used languages, and the fact that Slashdot commenters say insipidly, to wide modding-up, "I use the right tool for the right job," is irrelevant. Some languages are bad, and some are good. Acknowledging this is the first step to lessening the degree of incredible mediocrity that pervades the software industry today.

...What?

I understood that you were joking.  You stated that you respected your employer's investment in your time, which was obviously meant as mild irony, given that you are spending your working hours on reddit.

Har-de-har-har, I gave your comment an arrow up, thought it was entertaining enough.  I was merely continuing the joke with a little tongue-in-cheek statement which was also meant to show a certain lack of respect for an employer's investment in my time.  It wasn't meant to be side-splittingly funny, just a sort of light-hearted acknowledgement that I understand/familiarise with your statement.

I don't see how you could think that I missed your point when my tone was so clearly light/mildly humorous.

&gt; If it’s murder, how can you possibly justify killing a human being just because his or her father committed a criminal act?

Some women literally cannot bring a child to term when they are rape victims. It just totally screws them up emotionally and psychiologically.

I'm not saying that its necessarily the right thing to do, but I do believe in that situation it should be a choice of the mother, because she did not take the actions that led to her current situation. It was not her fault. Its not something done just out of convenience.

&gt; What if that child were brought to term, was born, and developed into an adult. Would it be okay to kill him at 30 years of age? If not, how can you advocate killing him in utero and still unhypocritically claim that a fetus is a human being?

Like I said, it depends on if the woman is emotionally stable enough to even bring the child to term. Not all can when it comes to rape. Rape is a pretty horrible act. I mean, I don't have first-hand experience, but rape involves one human being absolutely violating one another in the most disgraceful way possible. Rape can mess people up - and for some women, carrying the baby of the man who raped her can really hurt them.

evil, evil people
Its very simple logic.

A fetus is a developing human being. 20 years ago (or 30 years, ago, whatever fits you), you were a fetus also. You are now a human being.

Thus, logic leads that abortion is killing a human being. You can make excuses for it all you want, but its not difficult to understand.
yep, way off topic. You do understand sarcasm.
&gt; I find the phrase 'purely out of convenience' outrageous and insulting. I take it you're a guy ... and not a parent. The responsibility of properly raising a child is enormous, and the fear of being a crappy parent can be overwhelming -- even if you are married, have a job and a house, and such. It's easy to reach the conclusion that an abortion is better than dooming a kid to a life with crappy parents.

If you can't raise the child you shouldn't be doing things that by nature lead to having children.

This is a pretty crappy example, but it is one nonetheless: if I'm out joyriding and I slam into someone's car, I'm not going to force someone else to pay for what I did. I take responsibility for the actions I took that led to such consequences.

Abortion for convenience - and that's exactly what many abortions are about, are a result of people wanting to avoid consequences. Cause and effect. You don't want the effect, don't mess with the cause.

The funny thing is, after we removed the images, it looks more like what reddit would actually look like-- all text.
&gt; Some women literally cannot bring a child to term when they are rape victims. It just totally screws them up emotionally and psychiologically.

Huh. Think there are any women who would be similarly screwed up emotionally and psychologically by carrying a child to term in non-rape-related pregnancies? None?

What about kindof-rape? What about coercion that cannot be proven?

Would you require a rape conviction? Allegation? What if she doesn't want to go through that *either*?

Your use of the word "convenience" continues to be offensive and absurd. Your use of antibiotics is a similar "convenience". If it is not simply a matter of "convenience" for rape victims, then consider whether there are other pregnant women for whom it is also not an act of "convenience", and for whom it is none of your fucking business to determine their motives or intent.

If you do not stop using that sort of ludicrous derision, you have as much as admitted that you are not interested in rational debate on this issue.
Hmmm, why couldn't we apply that same logic even further back in chain of event.  If a fetus is a life, then the things involved in making a life, is a life.  And the act of making the life, is responsible for that life.  So not having that original act, is also potentially killing a life.  Based on this flawed reasoning... 

a) We need strong legistlation, to protect the sperm and egg.  No more spermicide or eggacide.  We must protect sperms and eggs because they can't protect themselves.  Stand up and speak for them, because they can't speak for themselves.  We need to control every egg and sperm. 

b) Every time two people get together, man and women, they must have sex.  If they don't have sex, they are potentially killing a possible life.  Don't let this killing happen.  Have sex with every person of the opposite sex you meet.  It your duty.  Don't let this sensing potential killing happen. 

I kinda like the b conclusion, sounds like a lot of fun :)

Well, that's a debate of a different sort. I'd just as soon see the government not allow "abort on demand," but I try to take a realistic perspective which accounts for the opinions of those that don't share my faith. Murder is widely acknowledged---even by atheists---to be at the very least an "inconvenience" to the victims... for abortion there's a significant divide between the rights-of-woman vs. rights-of-baby camps.

I mean, hey, I'm not sure divorce-on-demand is the greatest thing either, but how far will it get me to go tooting that horn?
This just goes to further prove my theory that at least ninety percent of all technological advancement is somehow motivated by the pursuit of sex.

Feb. 1982  --&gt; probably over half the reddit users were not yet born.
You can't apply the same logic even further back in the chain of events, because the objects you mention aren't even the same things.  An unborn child has all the same genetic material as a born child, even at cell 1.

Not so with sperms and eggs.
kind weird (lack of) sense of humor.
wow, even I have to rate myself down on that one.
&gt; Again you take your moral prejudice as axiom.

Moral prejudice? That's an interesting term. Does it describe the opinions you hold also, or does it somehow only apply to people like me?

&gt; There are perfectly good ways to avoid having children, from contraception to sterilisation; supporting those methods is much more effective at lowering unwanted childbirth rates than abstention (which doesn't even happen reliably amongst Christian kids, I'm sorry to tell you),

I'm not sure why you decided to turn this into an issue about abstinence. Abstinence is one of many ways to avoid having kids. My point wasn't that people should be abstinent if they don't want kids, my point purely was that's an ideal way to avoid getting yourself in a situation where you have to take the life of your child. You provided the other ways.

I also don't know why you felt the need to throw in the "Christian kids" part. I'm fully aware of that, thanks.

&gt; yet they are consistently opposed by those who would view one of the most fundamental behaviours of the whole animal kingdom as somehow sinful and deserving of punishment. The whole community is made to suffer - even putting their lives at risk - for the whims and hangups of a vocal minority. If you want to talk about immoral behaviour, perhaps we could start there?

Whoa, calm down now. We are talking about abortion, not your ideological crusade against Christianity.

Look, you may argue against me all you want, but its very rarely that I'll sit down in an arguement and say, "Its this way because God wants it." If I provide an arguement, its one that can be followed logically. I'm not advocating a pro-life stance here because I'm a Christian, but rather because logically I think that it makes sense if you don't want a child, don't have sex, and if you have a child because you have sex, you are responsible for that life.

But it seems like any post I make, you are sitting here trying to turn it into an arguement against my beliefs, instead of focusing on the point at hand.
I have not missed the point of the debate, because most of the legal arguments made in favor of government-tolerated abortion *assume* the unborn child is alive, and in some cases, a fully formed human being.  They can mostly be distilled into these (caricatured) forms:

* Certain people have inferior rights until they achieve a certain size.
* Women cannot possibly be bothered to provide for somebody else if they don't want to.  Under any circumstance, including life or death.

Check your pro-abortion ranks and the arguments actually used in legal circles.  If tomorrow everyone recognized that unborn children are fully human and alive, you would still find a quite sizeable contingent of people still asserting a woman's right to abort.

The only thing controversial about claiming developing children are, in fact, children, are the excuses the pro-abortion crowd keeps coming up with to avoid the obvious.  The evidence mounts year after year that we are dealing with *humans*.  An unborn child has a beating heart at three weeks, for goodness sake.  What qualities do you want these children to possess before you are satisfied that they are members of our society with the right to life like the rest of us?  Do they need to write a 1000 word essay and hum a few bars of the national anthem?  Win a gold medal in the Olypmics?

Correct me if I'm wrong. Usually y'all conservatives enjoy to point out to liberals such as myself that rights are inborn, and by that favorite conservative definition, they are things that you have all by yourself. Everything else is a privilege.

A two day old conception does not have that ability. It is not something that it has all by itself. I'm sure we both agree that I would not have a right to life if it required your kidney and no one else's. I wouldn't even malign your desire for the "convenience" of two kidneys.

You have ignored gwenhwyfaer's point. You have addressed what followed from that point, but not the origin:

You said, "*If you can't raise the child you shouldn't be doing things that by nature lead to having children,*" And that is only true for someone who subscribes to what I consider a twisted and evil moral system. You treat it as a fact that requires no explanation.
&gt; The biggest culprit is the technology that was supposed to make work quicker and easier, experts say.

Well if we were happy to only be as productive as in the 1960s it would have made our work quicker and easier.
True, things will get clicked on depending on how interesting it *seems* (not is), but titles should preferably be interesting by being representative, understandable and accurate title. Not shiny, now with more superlatives.

I mind vaguely titled things like that quantum article (though that was also the unclear article itself), inaccurate ones like that 'AJAX patented' one, and some others recently where after a few minutes of reading I discover that actually, no, this has nothing to do with what I was wanting to read about.

That defeats part of the point of reddit. It should make selection easier, and a representative title is the only thing I have to go on.

(...other than rating, but unless the article is undividedly interesting, it's probably due to a feedback effect in rating. I'm guessing the first few votes probably decide the nature of the next dozen, those and their timespan on where it goes from there. Actually, it'd be interesting to see some statistics on that, to see whether there is indeed a social effect to what should purely be article rating. Hm.)

Ah... So we've descended to the level of comparing newly-formed, embryonic children to cancer.  The miracle of life == the scourge of life.  Of course, zero tumors have actually grown to become fully functioning persons, but then, zero aborted children have, too.  So I suppose the comparison is accurate.

I am fully aware of the Catholic Church's objection to birth control and it is of a vastly different nature than their objection to abortion.  One opposition is in regards to the abuse of sex and the other is in regards to murder.  Sperms and eggs do not, by their very nature, require defense and succor.  Children do.
Oh right, the moral system protecting a human being from being murdered just because someone else decided to create them and then decided that they couldn't keep them is twisted.

What is twisted is your logic. You are making excuses for cold-blooded murder.

I do think that there are situations where abortion may be necessary. One of those situations isn't "I had sex with my boyfriend, now I'm pregnant, and I don't want my baby anymore."

You gotta take responsbility for what you've done. That's the nature of everything.

Ironically enough, it is Christianity that teaches that God died so that we wouldn't have to accept the consequences of all that we've done wrong, but that's another subject all together.

&gt; But surely the dependence of children upon their parents falls into a different category? Or are you of the worldview that parents have no duty to provide for even their born children?

Sure. But that duty has giant obvious limits. For example, if they are unwilling to fulfill it they may put their child up for adoption.

I would not have a right to life if it required your kidney *even if I was your child*. I would, of course, happily donate my kidney to my child. But that's my decision.

Particles are not in several places at once. That's just silly. It's more sensible to think of it as multiple (related) particles. They are all real. The computation is run by some of them. You do *not* get answers to computations that aren't run, that is magical thinking.

Here we are agreeing again, what a shock!  A parent has no duty to provide their child with their own kidneys, even if the child needs one.

But surely the duty to provide food and shelter for their children is within those giant obvious limits?  And isn't that basically what a woman is doing for the child in her womb?

I'm all for the law allowing parents to give up their children for adoption if they are unable to fulfill their duties, and I'm for the same tolerance for women in unwanted pregnancies.
They sure could use some modern Web technology on their website. Maybe that would keep it from sucking.

This has been studied for more than a decade.  See [Productivity Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_paradox).
&gt;But surely the duty to provide food and shelter for their children is within those giant obvious limits? And isn't that basically what a woman is doing for the child in her womb?

You are avoiding my point, successfully made. Providing food and shelter *is not* within that duty, as the child's parent may instead put it up for adoption. Similarly, carrying a child to term is not within that duty if the mother decides to have an abortion.

&gt;I'm all for the law allowing parents to give up their children for adoption if they are unable to fulfill their duties, and I'm for the same tolerance for women in unwanted pregnancies.

Ok. If you want to require women to put up their aborted fetuses for adoption, have a ball. If that is not your point, then you are not advocating the same level of tolerance for parents in those two situations. Don't pretend.
I'm sorry. That seemed like a rather straightforward reading of your rhetorical question.

Anyway, when I said I don't have a problem with legalizing prostitution I assumed that it was also understood that I don't have a problem with prostitutes.
&gt; isn't that basically what a woman is doing for the child in her womb?

Jesus Christ, God in Heaven, NO. I can't believe that didn't set me off on first reading. Yes, that is what it supplies to the fetus, but that ignores completely what it demands of the mother. You could just as easily say that kidneys provide unpoisoned nutrients, and thus must be dutifully supplied to your children.
One must not only go to an engineering school, but a school where the engineers are *in charge*. My university was very much an engineering school, but its administration was largely controlled by business majors and psychologists. This caused a few problems ...

lame, lame title but ok blog entry.
I think the complaint is that although it may be prosperous (however that is measured), the quality of life is much worse. Even medieval serfs had 80 days holiday a year. It's why the Italian slow movement has caught on - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Movement.
I think rsheridan is comparing one bundle of flesh to another.  Really just a rebuttal saying that because something has the same DNA as a human, doesn't mean it is a human/alive.  Similarly, we don't qualify our thumbs or arms as alive, needing special protection.  Otherwise, amputation should be reclassified as murder. 

Similarly, doesn't the sperm have the Male's DNA and the Egg's the Females DNA?
A lot of what we have talked about has gone around the point of whether the fetus is alive or not.  It seems very hard to convince a person to change their viewpoint on this, because it depends a lot on their belief system. 

What do people feel about the other participent in an abortion.  Does the woman have rights over her own body?  Is it even her body?  Who is more important, the baby or the Woman?  Will they bring back Melrose Place?
I do advocate the same level of tolerance.  When the unborn child develops enough so that it can be safely removed from the mother's womb for adoption, the law should allow it.

But despite that, you are still wrong, because parents *are* legally responsible for providing food and shelter for their children.  The adoption option is the *transferral* of that responsibility to another person.  Until that transfer occurs, however, a parent *must* provide for his or her child.  Their duty does not vanish immediately upon their arrival at the decision to cease being responsible for their children.  Were a parent to engage in such behavior, they would be commiting crimes of neglect and abandonment.

Similarly, a mother should be legally responsible for the health of her unborn child while she waits for somebody to take possession of the child for adoption just as she is responsible for the health of her *born* child while she waits for somebody to take possession of the child for adoption.
with commercials and all ? and a simplified plot and busty characters which is all people will remember ? merchandise ?
leave my Asimov alone :(
What separates my argument from yours and rsheridan's is this: What I call an embryonic child, even one without a nervous system, has one particular quality that all the sperms, eggs, tumors, and thumbs in the world do not: If allowed to develop in their natural environment, they will become recognizable humans.

I think you left out the chastity belt, when did they go out of style?  Maybe using Honour killings as a deterent, I heard they still work great in some places, you know it drives home the right moral values.  Masturbation is quite good, its 1/4 the fun, but it can't make children.  Or homosexuality, I mean that act can't naturally produce children.  Or just plain old anal/oral sex.  

I think our society has too choose one of the above as a national pasttime, so we can't engage in acts that can lead to producing children. :)
Agreed; I guess the guy's never heard of Coltrane.
&gt; I do advocate the same level of tolerance. When the unborn child develops enough so that it can be safely removed from the mother's womb for adoption, the law should allow it.

No. You advocate the same quality of life for the child. One parent you would require to purchase groceries and diapers for a month, the other parent you would require to bear a child. Those are two entirely different requirements. Two entirely different tolerances.

Please stop ignoring my point. I believe that for the same reason we must not coerce parents to supply, for example, their kidney to their child, we must also not coerce mothers to bear children when they do not wish to. Do you understand my analogy? Why is it invalid?
I believe a woman has rights over her own body *to a point.*  I do not believe she has the right to voluntarily deny sustenance to the baby in her womb.

As hard as it may be for some to believe, I sincerely sympathize with a mother who is in an unwanted, difficult pregnancy.  Men who put women into that situation should be severely punished.  In the case of rape, I'd listen to an argument for sending such men to the gallows.

But surely we humans are civilized enough to not *liquidate* innocent children when they become a burden.
The only distinctive quality I can see in your argument is that you delightedly threw your hands in the air when he said something that you could attack without addressing its merits. WTFG.

He did successfully point out that your criterion (has the same genetic material as a human) is a silly way of defining legally sanctified human life. Earlier, someone pointed out that the easier criterion (could one day become a human) is similarly silly.

His point has merit. *So does yours*. I totally understand that you can look at a single celled organism without a brain and consider it sacred human life. It is, obviously, a human life form. But you must also understand how others can look at it and see... a single celled organism without a brain. The potential for human life. Our perspective has merit. Fucking admit it already.

Horrible interface. This could so be reworked beautifully with Ajax and possibly Flash. Any designers interested in a side project?
Excellent point.  I would slightly reword it though: If allowed to develop, it has the *possibility* of becoming a human. 

Why this wording?  A baby can grow outside the original womb perhaps a surrogate womb.  Maybe in the future a labratory.

Possibility is used because the fetus may die, no fault of the mother.  We don't know what will happen (still-born birth)
And most of the movies that he said were hard to rent for lame reasons were also... lame movies. Movie-box designers and movie viewers have worked out a rather efficient form of communication. I know I don't want to watch seabiscuit. Woo.

Even Hotel Rwanda, which was a fantastic movie, is obviously not everyone's cup of tea. But I think putting "RWANDA" in the title might have been the more significant indicator than every indie award it could have collected.
I understand the analogy, and I think it is invalid.  Providing body parts for one's child is outside the limits of a parent's duty, but requiring a mother to bear her child to term is not.

A woman's body is precisely designed (or evolved, if you prefer) for, among other things, nourishing a newly-formed child from its embryonic stage to its birth.  However, no person's body is designed for being a parts depot for another person.  Is it possible for a person's body to be such?  Yes.  But then it's also possible for a person's body to be firewood for another person's fireplace.

So the distinction in my mind has to do with the natural function and purpose of a thing.  In this case, because a woman's body is naturally designed to nourish a newly-conceived child to birth, she is required to do so.  However, because a person's body is not designed to provide body parts to another person, he or she is not required to do so.

This reply is kind of charming, but you should really broaden your definition of prosperity (however you measure it) before you embarass yourself.

80 days of holiday a year is nice (even if we technically get 114 in the US), but their life expectancy was terribly short -- 50 years, at most.  A medieval serf -- or an enlightenment-era merchant or artisan, or a nobleman, for that matter -- lived a life with no antibiotics, a terrible diet, and zero attention paid to hygeine.  As a result, any encounter with infectious disease was potentially fatal, -- moreso if doctors got involved and started draining "fevered" blood out of your body while you were trying to recuperate.

I'll leave it to you to imagine what life was like to have limbs amputated with no anesthesia; or to envy rich people who could affort to own a book; or to be ruled by people who thought of you as property and who cut off bits and pieces of people who tried to run away; or to have right and wrong decided by ordeal, where the guy who lost the fewest fingers was the winner, or ...

And let's not forget the fact that when we say "hard work", we're talking about flipping hamburgers, or maybe sitting in a chair and writing things down all day long.  Have you ever held a job that required you to do continuous, strenuous physical labor?*  Do you ever intend to hold one again?  Isn't it nice to have a choice about that?

Awesome essay. Something to come back to from time to time to get some inspiration.
What I hated was the joysticks that had the little metal dome switches [inside](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/joystick1.htm) that would degrade with use over time until they just stopped working altogether.

The worst example must be the [Tetris Plug N Play](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002E7C9Q/103-1864251-2154200?v=glance) game from Radica. The controller is some ridiculously shaped cheap nasty twisty joystick that *never*, **ever** works the way you want it to. A classic game, one of the best ever, made worthless by the useless controller. It's tragic, they had the opportunity to create the perfect Tetris joystick, but instead they created the worst.
While it is hard for you to accept a zygote as a child, I assume you would agree that the full-term baby has met that status five minutes before it emerges from the womb in live birth.  However, in the eyes of many pro-abortion supporters, that condition is still not enough to prevent a woman from exercising her right to abortion.

Many of them *do* recognize the legitimacy of taking a child's life if the mother wishes to do so.  Naomi Wolf expresses this in her article, ["Our Bodies, Our Souls."](http://saturn.med.nyu.edu/~yeh/cf/resource/wolf.html)

Also, if you read the text of Justice Blackmun's decision-of-the-court in Roe v. Wade, you'll find that even though Texas law clearly defined when human life began, it was still not enough for the justices to tolerate them overriding a woman's right to abortion.

So be aware that the pro-abortion crowd does include those who are willing to terminate infant life, even if it is legally so defined.

"quality or relevance?"

I think the two components are more accurately described as content (topic and information relevance) and presentation (writing skills, layout, etc.).  These two combine into an overall *quality* and, for better or worse,  a single vote.  

It may not seem fair to merge these two aspects that can vary so widely.  But that's the compromise of a one-vote system.  The benefit being simplicity.  I see that simplicity as reddit's main strength.

I will *not* admit the merit of your point because it leads to arbitrary, subjective evaluations of what is human life and what isn't.  There is a grave danger in opening that can of worms, because someday, somebody might decide to move that line forward, past birth.

I'm sure it makes a lot of sense to you to declare that a child growing in the womb is not an individual until they develop to a certain point.  For sake of argument, let's put this line at the point when the organs are intact, the nervous system comes online, and brain waves begin to issue forth.

I call that subjective and arbitrary because the developing child is, objectively, little changed from five minutes before the arrival at that point.

This whole business of declaring when a child is actually a fully qualified human disquietingly lends to the idea of, "Quick, kill it before it becomes sentient!"
I did some work this evening to make separating subreddits by language easier. There isn't a noticeable difference at this point, but we're getting there.
I believe this distinction is important for wellbeing of everyone.

My apologies, let me state it more clearly:

As parents are required to provide food and shelter for their born children until that responsibility has been legally transferred to another, so must a pregnant mother be required to offer the equivalent sustenance to her unborn child by carrying the child to its birth.  A child's right to life imposes these duties.

Your Objection:  But while parents are obliged to provide food and shelter for born children, they are not required to give them their body parts.  Is not a woman giving of her body in a similar manner to her unborn child?

My Response:  No.  A woman's body is naturally suited to carrying her unborn child to its birth.  A man or woman's body is *not* naturally suited to providing body parts for children (or anybody else, for that matter).  A child's right to life does not require parents to undertake unnatural actions in support of that right, excepting those of common sense and specific legal mandate.

I say "common sense," because providing food and shelter to born children may be debated as a natural human action in some quarters, even though I can think of only a very few amount of people who hold to the worldview that parents have no such obligation to their children.
The "real" price of anything is only the value that YOU and I place on it. If, for instance, you valued the look of the dollar coin above the paper bill, in theory, without a a law attached, you would be able to buy more with it so long as the person agreed that the dollar coin was indeed more valuable. It is only with a combination of law and general public acceptance that we "value" both as one and the same. It's not so with the diamond industry and I have to say that De Beers with the help of their marketing company could sell a "ketchup popcile to a lady with white gloves." Unbelievable. I'm giving this article to every woman I date. It's time to educate the public.
[deleted]
The most significant aspect of the date, is that the article foreshadows the demise of the DeBeers cartel and the devaluation of diamonds due to a handful of factors (investment diamonds, new sources, loss of control over African mines, etc).

If anything, the diamond market (and DeBeers, I presume) is alive and flourishing... evident from displays of public consumption by rap artists (ice/bling) and airheaded hollywood socialites with diamond-crusted phones and ipods.

"...was recently speaking to a customer in the US about a credit card scheme."

I have to admit I have screamed at these credit and loan people myself. After phoning me up several times a week for almost a year, asking me if I need a loan, and me politely declining their offer or asking them to take me off their list, I got slightly annoyed (the worst bit was they weren't even ask for me, but the previous tenant of the flat).

First I started some light harassment, then I played along to waste their time. Was I interested in a loan? Sure! How much is my house worth? Blah, blah. I always asked where they had my phone number, street address and previous tenant name from. Some caller started insulting me when I queried this! However the calls never stopped.

Then I tried death threats.

I didn't get any calls for the last month I lived there.

For one thing, it would be interesting to know whether your rudeness has a place here.

Secondly, it appears that as profits, working hours and productivity have increased, wages have at best stagnated or even declined.

Holly Sklar [claims](http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/print.cgi?file=/views01/0829-08.htm), *"If wages had kept pace with rising productivity since 1968, the average hourly wage would have been $24.56 in 2000, rather than $13.74. The minimum wage would be $13.80--not $5.15. Profits also went up, but wages went down. Domestic corporate profits rose 64 percent since 1968, adjusting for inflation."*

Erik Rauch [points out](http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~rauch/worktime/), *"An average worker needs to work a mere 11 hours per week to produce as much as one working 40 hours per week in 1950. (The data here is from the US, but productivity increases in Europe and Japan have been of the same magnitude.) The conclusion is inescapable: if productivity means anything at all, a worker should be able to earn the same standard of living as a 1950 worker in only 11 hours per week."*

I would apply the standards of any right-thinking businessperson -- if you heard instead that wages have been sharply on the rise but profits haven't, wouldn't a real businessperson be investigating this further? When billionaire Warren Buffett gets on CNN and [argues](http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/10/buffett/index.html) *"It's class warfare, my class is winning, but they shouldn't be,"* perhaps that would raise a couple mental alarms?

Yes, about 20% of the population gets to have relatively empowered jobs where they're fairly self-managed. This corresponds to Barbara Ehrenreich's "New Class," or Parecon's "coordinator class" of professional, managerial and technocratic workers.

I don't think there's anything new about them; Parecon people posit that they were in control in the USSR, and there's always been professional priesthoods. Reminds me of Adam Smith's claim centuries ago that, *"People of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or some contrivance to raise prices."*

It's hard to beg the question when we're discussing an abstract definition. At least, I think so. It also prompts the questions:

* Do you agree libertarians are in favour of gun ownership?
* Do you agree libertarians are in favour of self defence using lethal means?
* Do you agree that your right to trial is dismissed in the case of being killed?
* Do you agree libertarians are therefore in favour of some cases where private ownership results in your rights being curbed when on someone elses land?
* Do you agree libertarians believe they are therefore allowed a subjective definition of "self defence"?
* Do you agree libertarians believe they are therefore entitled to defend (non lethally, I should hope) against other subjective transgressions, like theft?

You've had a lot of thoughtful posts so if I'm wrong, I'm interested in hearing your point of view. 

&gt;It also makes it clear that you are missing the central point of libertarianism - which is that freedoms may not be removed pre-emptively. Not for any reason. 

No, the basic principle of libertarianism is private ownership free from government coercion; free to do as you will with your life and your posessions. Free to do what you like on your land. Whether that involves doing any drugs on your own land, shooting tresspassers, building an extension to your house, burning crosses, making a rose garden, whatever.

If you suspect someone of stealing from you, while they are on your land, under libertarian principle, you should be able to detain them under the same self defence principles that would allow you to own any gun you like.

&gt;Your initial example is rooted in that misunderstanding, and is therefore erroneous;

Regardless of the examples, you're wrong here. "A implies B; Not A; Therefore Not B" is incorrect.
...and you think the Italian way of life is awful too?

In the comment section of the submission *Better explain what voting up/down means* user champion [writes](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=21yp#c21ys):

&gt; I'd originally thought that voting up/down a story was whether you liked it and would want it to be more popular.

Exactly what I thought for the first four weeks of using reddit.  However, user rahul responded:

&gt; From the FAQ:
&gt; "My votes train a filter?
&gt; Yep, so vote up links you liked and vote down links you disliked. Our hope is that instead of just reading a list of links the community thinks should be on the front page, you'll also be reading a "front page" personalized for you (filtered for quality by your fellow redditors, but filtered for relevance by you). Let reddit know if it's hot or cold. Find these personalized links in your recommended section."

This seems to answer the question.  Case closed.  Really?  I don't think so.

Let's start with the terminology of the [faq entry](http://features.reddit.com/help/faq):  If reddit really is about filtering
aticles according to how relevant they are to *me*, then why are the guys
constantly talking about *votes*.  Voting is about determining what a
*collective* thinks is the best according to some scale and *not*
what the individual thinks is best.

Secondly: Why are scores shown all over the place?  I'm not interested in what
other people think is relevant to them!  And what is the idea behind 'top'?  The
existence of this page is probably the most important reason why people tend to
think reddit is about finding the consensus about what the best article is.

*If* the 'votes' reflect relevance to individuals, then why submissions
disappear (beyond the minus-4-horizont) as soon as some other people think they
are not relevant to *them*?  Couldn't they nevertheless be relevant to me?
Maybe the other users thought: "Well-written article, but I'm not interested."

Conclusion:  It's no surprise that people misconceive reddit as a
yay-or-boo-thingy (as PG called it in a
[comment](http://reddit.com/info?id=1z85#c1zj7)).  Furthermore the choice of the
term vote, some UI decisions etc. suggests that the guys themselves are not
really sure about what they want reddit to be.

So what's the reason for all this confusion?  I think the problem is that there
are two important dimensions that make up the space of articles: relevance and
quality.  Relevance is related to the individual user and quality is a consensus of
the collective.  (So quality is something you can really vote on.)

But the problem is now that the users are only given a tool to position the
submission in *one* dimension and this dimension is in fact: both,
relevance *and* quality commingled.  And as always when you project from a n-dimensional
space to a space with less dimensions, information is lost.  You simply cannot
figure out whether the user thought the submission was relevant or high-quality
by looking at his votes.  The solution to this dilemma is obvious: treat
relevance and quality separately.

There already has been a [proposal about how to do this](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=220l)
 by user jbstjohn.  He proposes having
two sets of up/down.  His analysis must have been similar to mine, but his
solution is needlessly complex.  The point is that users *already*
make the two distinct decisions but reddit simply doesn't exploit that: The decision on quality is done by using the arrows and **the
decision on relevance is implicitly done by *clicking* submissions!**  If I'm not
interested in games, I wont click titles indicating this topic.  If I'm
interested in hydrogen producing algea, I will click titles talking about this
stuff.  Sometimes it will happen that I click a title and find that I was wrong
with my assumption about the topic.  But this is maybe one in forty cases and
shouldn't crush the filter which works statistically and is therefore prepared
to deal with some noise.

So what to do now?  In my humble opinion:

* let's vote on quality and make scores officially being a measure for quality
* therefore display them all over the place (people like scores and charts about them)
* but use the clicks to train the filter
* and use quality *and* relevance to compile the recommended page

(Sorry for my poor english.)

Good points.
I think animal testing of cosmetics is a red herring, nobody promotes it, and cosmetics companies know their brand is in trouble if they're caught doing it.

The spectre of cosmetics testing as an excuse to support anti-vivisection groups is turning a blind eye to what these groups really target.
In fact I'm burning my holidays.  But I can't help it, I like the little alien from the future.
And then, on an ongoing basis, gather bookmarks you put elsewhere as implicit "thumbs up" points, so that even if I don't use the reddit interface per se to enter my data, I can still get the value out of it (and reddit gets better with more data)
I quit recycling the day I saw the massive recycle truck alternately gun the engine and screech the brakes between bins.  It no doubt burns more diesel than what is save by recycling a couple of milk jugs.  

No aluminum cans.  I switched from Coke to home-made sweet tea.  Only 1/3 the sugar, taste better too.

No newspapers.  I used to read the comics but I became too busy for that.

A simple and already effective improvement would be to remove the BLINK tag.
Look, I LOVE animals, but they're animals, they're not people.  If we can responsibly use animals for the betterment of mankind, we SHOULD.
In general I think your conclusions are right, but one thing I do like about the arrows for training relevancy is I have to make a conscious choice about making something relevant, and I get the opportunity to de-select later if I wish.

You could say that letting the preference filter show you what you've really indicated you like is better than manually telling it what you think you like. But personally I like the option of reading many entries and only voting on a few.  I have a feeling that if click-throughs were used in this fashions, many people's recommended queues would quickly become overly self reinforcing.

I think it would be nice if the links contained the extensions, and the URL dispatcher ignored the extensions. For example, if http://features.reddit.com/goto?id=27bt was a pdf it would be posted as http://features.reddit.com/goto?id=27bt.pdf.

laughing my ass off! If you follow Joel, some of this may seem a little, well, true.
I went without healthcare for about 5 years, and I did it by saving money, and taking care of myself, so I did not need to spend much time in hospitals.  If I could get an extra $2K/year right now in exchange for getting rid of my health care,  I would do it in a heartbeat.
I can understand why people with kids might feel that they need insurance, but I don't understand why so few unattached people self-insure.  Insurance companies do not have a magic health-care wand that we don't have access to-all they do is take a bunch of people's money, hack some percent off the top for themselves, and then give it back out to (some subset of) the participants get sick.  It therefore follows that if you are healthier than average (not overweight, don't smoke, no family history of predisposition toward disease, etc.), you are probably better off saving money yourself than going with health insurance.  
It does take some risk-tolerance to pull this off-I fell off my bike around year 3, broke my fall with my forehead, and was in tough shape for 2 days.  I was pretty confident that worst case, I had a concussion, and that I would be ok within a few days.  I was right, but it was a little scary far a while.
As an aside, the scale effect that you mention is actually available to people who self-insure, too-there is a freelancer's union that offers medical insurance, for a relatively reasonable price, if memory serves.
Actually the invasion of Iraq WAS a response to 9/11. However, Iraq had no connection with 9/11.

The article has nothing to do with Web Services. It has to do with how the service industry is using the web.
I think there are two major problems with MLG ever becoming something more than a small league that few people know about.

1) Watching someone play videogames isn't terribly interesting for most people.

2) The people who would be the star "athletes" of professional videogaming aren't particularly likeable individuals. I've talked to some MLG players, hell, I personally have played against OGRE 1, OGRE 2 (the top MLG Halo 2 players in the world), and they generally all have one thing in common: high school kids who are cocky as hell but are a bit lacking in their social skills. The NBA is likeable because of characters like Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Wilt Chamberlain, etc. In pro football you had people like John Elway, Emmitt Smith, Lawrence Taylor. But professional gamers just don't present that kind of allure. How many people are going to be captivated by stories of 16-year olds who play videogames for 6-7 hours a day? That market has to be pretty small.

MLG as it currently exists is far from being respectable or professional. If you don't believe me, just head on over to their forums and get a load of their fanbase.
Ok fair enough, I see you are just trying to contribute to the reddit community.
1) It may not be interesting to you, but it might be interesting to other people.  South Korea already does it.  They have gaming tv. Some of their top gamers are arguably as popular as TV stars there -&gt; http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,399476,00.html

2) I am sure there are going to be big jerks in the MLG, but I don't doubt there are jerks in MLB or NBA.  That alone isn't an argument against it.  There are jerks everywhere.  Heck, sometimes (more often then not), I am a jerk.  One hella-ova Jerk, I am.
Well, Bush has got a whole lot of Americans convinced that there was a connection.

Your link is to the second page of a two page article. On the [previous page](http://cooltech.iafrica.com/features/508857.htm), some comparisons with traditional solar cells are given:

&gt; Professor Alberts says the thin film technology he and his team developed can generate up to 150 watts of electrical power at a cost below R10 per watt peak. He adds that it has demonstrated not only high efficiency, but also long-term performance stability. “The pilot plant demonstrated that these thin film solar modules could be produced by highly scalable and proven industrial technologies such as physical vapour phase deposition and diffusion processes.” Commercial-scale thin film modules are being produced with output powers between 10 and 40W in direct sunlight.

&gt; Quoted costs of R10/Wp look highly favourable against the cost of “traditional” electricity. And better still against the R35 per watt production cost of conventional modules. The import price locally of a silicon-based 50W solar panel is about R2000 (R40/Wp).



I can't remember the last time I read such illiterate, inane bullshit. The entire article is absolute drivel from beginning to end.

"A more expensive jacket will always be a better fit", huh?

*I tried death threats.*

Has the FBI stopped by yet?
Huh. You didn't explain how you got back to using the phrase "right to life" for something that has no innate ability to live. But whatever:

I didn't misunderstand. You were perfectly clear in that earlier quoted sentence. I am saying that while women's bodies can naturally function to bear children, that does not explain why you insist that we must force them to do so. Your conclusion does not follow from your argument. If you would like to explain *why* the natural ability of women's bodies means that we must force them to bear children when they do not wish to, then I could approach your argument.

Right now it smells too fucking despicable.
There's a story that circulates around in academia, not sure if it's true, but basically some animal rights people went and released hundreds of animals from a research facility (rabbits I believe).

The next day, the vast majority of the animals were found dead within 100 yds of the facility because they were domesticated animals, etc.

To top it off, it invalidated a multiyear study using the rabbits (that was going to end within a month or week or something like that).

Again, no idea if its true or what is and isnt true, but it wouldnt surprise me at all.  And this story goes around regularly so it's kind of become a legend about why to lock your stuff up and have security on any high importance trials.

If you won't accept my point because of some imaginary place it could lead, then you have given up on your own argument.

&gt; I call that subjective and arbitrary because the developing child is, objectively, little changed from five minutes before the arrival at that point.

I don't see how that makes it arbitrary.

&gt; This whole business of declaring when a child is actually a fully qualified human disquietingly lends to the idea of, "Quick, kill it before it becomes sentient!"

Ok. That isn't disquieting. You might like to make it sound bad, but it isn't, and it doesn't disprove the point.
Deleting in protest of Reddit's new anti-user admin policies.
The threats appear to be from the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), which is more militant than PETA.  I don't consider PETA saintly, but PETA is much more above the board and mainstream than ALF is.

Does anybody remember that old Bloom County cartoon where Opus is rescued from the Mary Kay Commandos by ALF?  ALF restored him to his natural habitat by throwing him in the ice machine outside a convenience store.
Yes.  You failed to rebut any of his points, and took a swipe instead.  That was lazy, and turning a non-thought into a comment makes you look somewhat stupid.  Why bother doing so?
Have reddit users sign up to have their digg feeds turn into reddit submissions or "up" votes, so you get more of the existing data without making people have to vote on everything twice.
As an Indian who gets 3 calls every day from various agents from India wanting to give me a credit card or a personal loan, I can say that I feel hostile and it has nothing to do with job losses or racism. The stories in the article seem to be about outbound sales calls, not customer service calls, and I suspect the "customers" are feeling the same hostility.
The single most salient point is that the arrows are a poor choice for the UI.  Looking at a list of items in a particular order, and seeing an up or down arrow next to each item in the list, implies that the arrows influence the order by pushing items either up or down.  I'm not certain what the best choice is (thumbs up/thumbs down is at least dissociated from the ordering, and becoming a cliche in some circles, not unlike the Amazon stars) but the current icons aren't it.

Having a popup/flyover indicate that the results of your clicking can be found in 'Recommended' would be a good start.  Like tmalsburg, I read the explanation when I first arrived at reddit, then promptly forgot what it meant.
While I don't know much about an incident like that I do remember a break in [from 1999](http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug99/sc1.html) that resulted mostly in destruction and death.  2 million in damage, 13 of 27 pigeons missing, and rats found dead.

Since they are so unsuccessful at the goal of saving particular animals, I can only conclude that the break-ins are meant to get people thinking about animal testing in general.  Even then, the break-ins are a bad idea, as they make everyone sympathize with the researchers and prejudiced against animal rights activists.

One thing it does seem to do, however, is intimidate researchers.  Not very effectively, but the article proves it does happen.
I call junk statistics.  I looked at the online trade mag that the blog linked to (and cited) and couldnt tell which article it was referring to.  The stats in the articles I did read were weak at best.  (plus, there is some clear bias in the trade mag)
Converting the prices you go from about 6.50$ per Watt peak, to 1.63$, so the solar panel cost drops from 326$ to 81$, which is much more reasonable, so much more likely to be used.

Though you still need to look at the cost of, and impact of the batteries needed to run everything at night.

It's amazing how some of the people really *are* totally magazine-type beautiful before the edits.
It's especially interesting to see how much skinnier a model can become as a result of the photo manipulation.  The shot of  Paris and what's-her-name shows this, as do a couple others.  I shudder to think that some women are comparing themselves to these photos.

It's also weird that the major change to these photos seems to be a smoothing and matteing (sp? is that even a word?) of the skin.  When contrasted with the "before" people all the "after" people appear to be made of plastic.
This looks to me like more evidence of how overblown the whole online console gaming phenom is becoming. I'm predicting that insofar as the new systems hope to cash in on multiplayer becoming a huge attraction, they will fail utterly. The MLG, of course, will never go mainstream (the comparison to collectible card games was dead-on, in my opinion), but in a larger sense the whole push towards broadband gaming (with strangers across the country, yippee!) is just a half-assed attempt by gutless industry execs to flog new life out of their obnoxiously generic FPS's and sports games instead of taking a risk on something genuinely innovative. I highly recommend this article, which gives such short-sighted thinking a pretty good skewering:

There's a difference between being a jerk Terrell Owens style and it making interesting storylines in the league and being a jerk along the lines of, "Last game I played you, I totally owned you. You are a freaking noob and suck at sniping." And yes, that happens in MLG. Actually, the MLG storylines remind me a bit of the nonsense that is WWF and pro wrestling.

Agreed, its good to see them focused on the product.

But, its important to remember that without revenue, its hard to sustain the service and continually invest in it.  Lack of revenue creates risk and limits what they can do with the product.  Simple economic reality of limited resources.  (Unless of course they open up the platform to outside development or something, which doesn't seem to be part of their agenda).

In the last eight months, I've traveled to St. Louis, Portland, London, Chicago,  and Geneva, and I haven't encountered anything like the horrors described in the article. The screening practices may be useless theater, but I haven't found them to be offensive or invasive. My wife, infant daughter, and I regularly get through security in fifteen to thirty minutes. 

The worst airport experiences I've ever had were in 2002 in Paris, Lisbon, and Barcelona.

Then again, reply'rs often quote the parents comments. If the parent poster suddenly realizes that he totally misunderstood the topic or his comment was otherwise detracting from everything else then it is good for him to be able to kill the thread.

This is important since reddit does no hiding of lowly ranked comments.

I find her portrayal of American security checks in airports very similar to my experiences. However, if you've flown and had these experiences, then why bother writing an article about it? Either people already know this stuff, or they haven't had your experiences, or they don't fly, so they won't likely care.

Pointless article.
It's okay, but I'd probably like it more if the before and afters were all associated with the right pictures.
Now we're onto something.. A new reddit thats linked to your paypal account. Bear with me:

Each link represents a verified startup. The link points to a page that summarizes the projects their working on. Whenever you click on a link it donates $1 to them.

Ok, I haven't figured out how the end user gets profit back, except that the startup will get a list of donators..

Alright scratch that. Lets say that the companies above are instead teams that work on open source software. The end user gets the benefit of using the great stuff they are able to work on more due to donations.

Doesn't everyone think that a nice, simple, centralized donation system like this is just what the OSS community neads?
Politics news kills tech sites.
Interesting... my initial thoughts upon encountering reddit was "oh, I see if I like this link/article I can mod it up by clicking the arrow so that **other people** know that this is indeed a worthy read. Cool!"  But now, after having used reddit for several weeks now, I find myself having to determine whether I want to click the up or down arrow and how it will affect what I see.  Really, I shouldn't have to "think about the process", I should just say, "that article was terrible" followed by instinctually clicking the down arrow, not "that article was terrible, but I am interested in seeeing more articles on zen meditation."  That's where the problem occurs.  

tmalsburg seems to have the same issues and has what appears to be a reasonable solution since I could click the link - registering that I like said topic - then mod it up/down - registering to others it's quality.
Have Reddit readers never seen images retouched before? This stuff seems pretty standard to me.
I intended to make fun, but not by putting words in anyone's mouth.  In American politics, there are certain words that only ever get used by people with an axe to grind.  Republicans don't talk about "capitalism", no matter how much they may be in favor of it, but they're perfectly happy to call Democrats' plans for universal health care "socialist".  "Sustainable" is an Green/environmentalist word, etc.

"Corporation" was appropriated by the WTO-protester set in the 1990s, and has moved towards the political center by morphing into general plutophobia.

Whatever you may believe about global capitalism, attacking straw-man corporations as a proxy is pretty silly.  In the US, corporations employ maybe 15% of the work force (sarbox will shrink that figure), and only 2-3% of those people work for the big, scary *global corporations* that everyone's been up in arms about.  The proportion of wealth they control is similarly small.  Most businesses are partnerships or proprietorships and have only a handful of employees.  Most corporations (95% +/-5) have no employees or assets, and exist so that self-employed people can shield themselves from liability.

On the other hand, if you're really concerned about things like third-world poverty, environmental depredation, genocide and whatnot, there are all kinds of more productive targets out there.  Corrupt bureaucracies, dictatorships, developing nations and former communist states are where I'd start if I thought the world were broken and needed fixing.

The head of UN Peacekeepers [agrees with me](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4746216.stm), so I'd say that's a fairly objective statement of fact.
Not at all.  My whole point, if you had bothered to look past my total condescension and contempt (shame on you!), was that the relevant distinction is between medieval serfs and modern citizens, not between modern Americans, modern Italians, or residents between any other modern country.

I tend to think that comparisons between different nations' standards of living is counterproductive.  Modern standards of living are **SO** much higher than historical ones that lifestyle differences between cultures come out in a wash.  Besides, nobody can be expected to make an objective comparison between their own country (i.e. "us") and other countries (i.e. "them) -- except the people who sincerely believe they have proof that their lifestyle is the best :-)

Perhaps someone who has flown on El Al can comment on what effective airport security is like.  My guess is that it sucks at least as much as what we're putting up with here in the U.S. and probably more.
Yes!  They essentially cut off half of Nicole Richie's body.  That was the scariest one to me.  For the rest, they mostly just got rid of any freckles or other imperfections that actually make them look human.  By the end, it looks like their skin could be computer-generated (which it essentially is, I guess).
Mac users may not like this one, but it is a serious flaw that does expose Mac users to malicious code.  I wouldn't call mac users the most sophisticated users, I would call them falsely secure in their OS.  "Mac's can't get infected" is a fallacy that will prove devistating.  "Macs are more secure than Windows" may be true on most accounts, but it is now demonstrated that Mac users are vulnerable to the same group of problems that Windows users have suffered for well over a decade.
I appreciate the fact that you didn't respond to my rudeness in kind -- I probably misread chu's comment above.

The problem with your argument about productivity and the minimum wage is that productivity increases don't just happen -- you have to find ways to innovate.  In the post-WWII years,  advances in automation and control engineering were increasing the productivity of the average *factory worker*.  Today, we're increasing the productivity of managers and marketers with web shopping and data mining.  

It's un-sayable in a political environment, but the ugly truth is that minimum-wage employees aren't driving today's boom in personal productivity.  That leaves Gini-watchers with few options:

1. Do nothing (i.e. spend money on worker-education and vocational training, then hope for the best)

2. Redistribute Income -- Paul Graham [tells us what to think](http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html) there:
&gt; Let's rehearse the chain of argument so far. I'm heading for a conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking and screaming, so I've tried to make each link unbreakable. Decreasing economic inequality means taking money from the rich. Since risk and reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically decreases people's appetite for risk. Startups are intrinsically risky. Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk, founders will not invest their time in a startup. Founders are irreplaceable. So eliminating economic inequality means eliminating startups.

3. Raise the minimum wage -- which we try to do, but has all kinds of potentially distortionary effects.  Many of Wal-Mart's much-lamented labor practices like 39 hour workweeks for part-timers and clock-shaving by managers are an effort by the firm to recoup the value in labor of the amount they're required to spend in wages.

made only partly uselful because you did not speak of the average household bandwidth and latency disparities - if any between the two countries.

in india i can tell you that the average household bandwidth is 64kbps/64kbps on paper.  efficiency provides only 75% of the rated speeds.  latency is close to .5 to 1 second against servers outside india. all broadband connections rated at 64kbps have between 750MB to 1GB monthly download cap.  hence the net is almost impractical from both cost and operations point of view.

It seems like I see an article like this on slashdot or some similar site once every 6 months.

I'll believe it when I can buy it.
Huh? http://reddit.com/info?id=23v5
&gt; I shudder to think that some women are comparing themselves to these photos.

anyone who sees images like this compares themselves to it on some level, men and women alike.  we can't see this as just a women's issue, sadly.
So... where do you see that on the webpage? I couldn't find anything beyond the name of the consumable products.

I'm amazed at how much armpit editing goes on.

Well...a lot of that is because halfway competent students have a knack for fucking up other student's wireless connectivity if they bring their own wifi devices.  That leads to a lot of support calls from clueless students, along with indignant denials from the incompetent fuckups that of *course* their router couldn't be the problem.

Engineering schools often do better because their students are more tech-savvy, not because their IT departments are.  If you go to MIT, it's a fairly safe bet that your average student can setup a wireless router with no problem.  If you go to Amherst, not so much.
Uh, yes. Apparently only very few of them are so.
I'll never let someone take my picture again.

The low life expectancy in pre-20th century times is somewhat misleading, because of the high infant mortality.  It's true that *average* life expectancy was less than 50 years, but that's because a large number of infants died before the age of 2, not because the population as a whole lived shorter lives.  If you survived to adolescence, you had as good a chance of living to age 60-80 as you do today.

You can verify this by visiting any cemetary.  There are *lots* of graves of people that were 60, 70, 80, even 90 years old.  There are also lots of small headstones for children that died at age 5.

To put it cynically, we now kill our babies before they're born or conceived rather than letting them die in childhood.  Somewhat more humane, but it can do ugly things to the numbers.

Why the fuck is nsfw stuff appearing on the main redit site???
Your definition is significantly different from tss's definition - almost anything can be argued as "changing for the better". That is why I asked the question.
Worst page ever? I just see a headline with a button to disable an ad. But it doesn't work.

And the link "Continue to" doesn't work either.

No, really, what separates the pain a human feels from that of what an animal feels? What is the difference? Why do you feel for the pain of one over the other? Don't they respond to the drugs and pain the same way we do, isn't that why we use them for experiments?

Could they please stop inventing new user interfaces with the only property of being "cool". I want efficient and/or fast and/or learnable user interfaces, coolness is nice on video but it fades fast (as does, to a lesser extent, learnability) when using the interface daily.
Agreed, I would definitely say this is not safe for work -- especially that vag-eye-na.


While on the subject of filters, how does the filter work anyway? Is it an 'empirical' formula conceived after much trial and error? Is it some sort of Bayesian filter? Does it look for keywords and keeps track of what keywords you liked/disliked?

I never use the *Recommended* section, I really don't know why. Maybe because I don't want to miss something interesting (which ultimately means I don't trust the filter). Voting based on quality/importance seems more logical to me, since all reddit user will benefit from it. But then again, don't vote after reading *only* the link title.
http://www.nearlygood.com/video/monkeytorture.html
Isn't there a very simple solution to this?

I've personally always wondered why exactly where was the option to both vote an article up/down and also a save button. It always seemed unnecessary to me to have both, because if you vote an article up or down, it'll be "saved" for you later anyway. Same with hide, although it does have a very real physical function (it makes the article disappear from your view).

Why not in some way identify the save/hide buttons as ways to affect your recommended page? After all, saving/hiding articles is a personal thing - it affects no one else but you.

Is that just too simple of a solution or am I missing something here?

Cliff note's version: Up/down stay as they are, with the exception that they no longer will affect your recommended page and ratings based off that, and the save/hide buttons will be used to affect your recommended page (and related features) instead.


Plus this keeps the current simplicity of reddit...there's no real reason to add yet another feature if a current feature will do the trick very well. Its just that it needs to be obvious in some way (as others have, said, maybe a hover-box) that will make it clear that save/hide will affect your personal recommendations.
No, we use them for experiments because most of us **value human life more than animal life**, and experiments on them may increase the quality of human life.  I'm not advocating torturing fuzzy bunnies, I'm advocating responsible experimentation, as I stated originally.

OK... I agree that both men and women may compare themselves to magazine "ideals".  *However*, the different frequencies of eating disorders, negative self-image, elective cosmetic surgery, etc. (as well as casual observation) certainly suggest that women do so more often, or perhaps more seriously, than do men.

It's not just a womens' issue, but there are differences in how such media depicts and affects male and female audiences.
I'm going to relate this to the NBA dunk competition, but stay with me. The rules to the dunk competition have changed to allow players many attempts unlike old rules which allowed for only 2. This (like the skating rules) allows competitors to attempt difficult and innovative performances instead of playing it safe. As a result, the most recent competition had one player miss 14 dunks in a row, but it also had some of the greatest slams in recent years, including the incredible one by [Andre Igoudala](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuO2VrjXb44). The point is, there are trade offs to having the skaters attempt difficult performances without losing due to a mistake.

I don't think clicking is a good way to train the filter. I often click something out of curiosity on the "new" page but then see on the full page that it really doesn't interest me. One sentence isn't really enough to see wether something is interesting, it works especially bad for intentional spam.
There's a link to view a picture of the product, and the contents are written on the [canister label](http://www.gesecurity.com/portal/mdme_cache/mdme_images/t04/0000000/r00618v-1.jpg)

I just got curious what it actually is... this is the only way to determine the contents that I could find.
Heh. One more thing to make me go blind.
&gt; I never use the Recommended section, I really don't know why. Maybe because I don't want to miss something interesting (which ultimately means I don't trust the filter).

I feel the exact same way.

One thing I just happened to notice: just for the heck of it decided to check out the recommendation link, and one of the links there was called, " Add features without sacrificing simplicity (i.e. don't kill your best asset)". Now on the features subreddit, I've never ever voted an article up or down, but the title is extremely similar to a statement I just made in my comment. So is recommendation somehow tied into comments?
I was 100% behind your proposal until I realized something: clicking on submissions is NOT a good way to decide on relevance. Most users would click on the submissions before looking at any comments, right?  So what if I submitted a link on oranges, but titled it "top 10 Lisp programming errors"?  that title would garner a lot of  click-throughs but the submission was low quality.  I would only see the 'don't click' warnings after i popped into the comments to complain.

Since we're talking about two axes here, why not create an icon that's a standard decision matrix?  You have a good/no good axis on the vertical, and a relevant/not relevant on the horizontal, and people would just click on the quadrant that matches their impressions.  public scoring is based on the quality scores, and your filter is trained with the relevancy axis.  it might also be interesting to let high-karma people's relevancy rankings influence some of the articles too. (maybe a preference would work - ie: I trust your quality/relevancy plots, so let your relevancy filter affect mine)

With that, I think it might be interesting to see a zoomed in scatter plot when you view comments - get a sense of where articles are generally being plotted.
I wish I could believe that continued revelations such as this would have some impact on policy or public opinion but I don't. The Bush cabal is convinced of its moral and ideological rightness and no pesky facts will trouble their incurious sleep. Bush, Cheney, Rummie et al will go to their graves convinced they were right even as the next generation struggles with the consequences of their blind and bloody hubris. As for the public, enough subscribe to the "Bush is a good and godly man and therefore everything he does is right" school of non-thought to counterbalance us poor saps   in the reality-based community.

The fact that you can do something doesn't mean that you should. Semitransparent windows look cool, but they're a huge pain to actually use. Having windows act like a cross between jello and rubber when you drag them around makes interacting with them harder because you don't instantly see where they're going to end up. It's a cool demo, but I'd turn these features off on a system I actually wanted to use.

Although media images are obviously a huge contributor to anorexia and bulemia, they also have very subtle and far-reaching effects on everyone who sees them-- in terms of what we expect from ourselves, from others, and what we're willing to buy in hopes of getting that.

I just flew the same itinerary (LGA-PBI-LGA) on Song/Delta and it wasn't that bad from a security standpoint. Although some of the comments about barked orders and kids' anxieties weren't too far off the mark. You have a lot of old travelers, inexeperienced travelers and families with little kids on the route. Especially over Presidents' day weekend.

Palm Beach International has numerous private security personnel in addition to the TSA to help the process along. Airports are the lifeblood of Florida - the local chambers of commerce take them very seriously. The screeners *were* spending a lot of time searching grandma.

old news
Why should we value human life more than Chimp life?
tmalsburg, I like the thought you have put into your comment, and it seems a lot of us have been having the same ideas.  I think the solution though is to keep the arrows as they are.  Adding more arrows or stars or whatever would just clutter reddit's nice interface.  So it would seem that what you click on, as you suggested, is all you have left - but that is also a bad idea for some obvious reasons. 

I think that really the problem boils down to what people expect their vote means in terms of training their own filter for their recommeded page.  Most of us believe that there is some kind of tagging system going on behind the scenes, hence the connundrum when you like a particular topic but not a particular article.  Do you vote it down or not for fear that articles on that topic will disappear from your recommended page.

Now the reddit guys seem pretty smart, and hopefully they aren't using any explicit tagging system.  The best solution would be to do some data clustering on users based on what they "vote" up or down.  That way people with similiar interests could vote up and down the good and bad articles on the same topic, be whatever it is, and only the good would be recommended to you.  

For some info on data clustering see [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering)

The party in power makes no difference what-so-ever when it comes to government spending.  The government has grown during every single administration since FDR (and probably before).

The only way to reduce government spending is to consistently take out of office anyone who proposes anything other than reducing the size of the government, regardless of the program.  This has to be done at all levels of government and regardless of anything else the person may have done.  Voting for new programs or increased taxes should be political suicide.

Most things are not the government's business and, therefore, the government does not need money to act on those things.

The part in my opinion that makes her (thank you for pointing that out godslaughter) seem insecure to me is having to note the age at which the bachelors degree was obtained.

But, this is old news, this was on reddit days ago.
There is a publication (I would call it a newspaper, but it might be monthly or something) that does indeed use the term Amerika on a regular basis.  I do not recall what its name was, but it was something like "socialist worker".  Here is an example of an online article that uses the term unironically:
http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/mn/sept112001/wcpersynalattacks.html

I suppose they might just be bad spellers, given that they think Churchhill suffered "persynal" attacks, but I doubt it.

I haven't flown El Al, but I did fly Lufthansa out of Tel Aviv a couple of years back, so I have some experience with Israeli airport security.

It didn't suck as much as what we have here, and that's for a couple of reasons.  First, they have more experience with it.  But primarily it was because Israeli airport security concentrates on what actually makes a difference, and not on what makes a big show.

For example, our checked baggage was depressurized before the flight, to make sure that it didn't contain pressure-fused bombs.  

This isn't a big, obvious thing, but it is a lot more useful than making everyone take off their shoes---which we didn't have to do.

Not that there wasn't plenty of "security theater" too; you can't go into a public building like a shopping center without a guard peering casually into your briefcase first.

How very reddit.  Religion is a silly, superstitious exercise and ultimately contains the logical seeds of its own destruction.  *Quelle surprise*.

This is features.reddit.com, for suggesting features that should be added to reddit. You probably want the main reddit page.
Well, sorry, I have to disagree. Because I think that arrows are actually the *best* metaphor.

&gt; seeing an up or down arrow next to each item in 
&gt; the list, implies that the arrows influence the 
&gt; order by pushing items either up or down. 

Yepp, and that's exactly what those arrows do! If you click the up arrow, you push the item up the list (though, admittedly, not always in the literal sense). And if you click the down arrow, you push the item down (this time, in the most literal sense: it completely disappears from the list).

For me, the metaphor works incredibly well.

You know, personally, I think reddit should just stick with its darn beautiful simplicity. Heck, that's the main if not the only point why Reddit is so different and orders of magnitude better than the other gazillion similar sites out there. *It's not crammed with junk.*

I don't need no freaking stars. I don't need no freaking plots, pop-ups or tooltips. I don't want no freaking voting matrices. Come on, give me a break. I don't want to have to vote an item on a bunch of totally independent yet mysteriously interwoven steplessly zoomable scales. I just want to make a binary choice. Good, no good. Period.

You know, if I want to see some useless charts, I can go to *any* stupid site out there. I don't need Reddit for that. 
Reddit is not about all-singing, all-dancing, hideous thingies. It's about focus, simplicity and beauty. 

Please don't change it.

Ah, and one more thing.

tmalsburg does have a point over there:

&gt; let's vote on quality and make scores 
&gt; officially being a measure for quality

That's an excellent suggestion. The only problem is: *it will never work*. This is the Internet. You can't agree on *anything* here. And we most certainly cannot *coerce* anyone into doing anything. 

Whenever I cast a vote, you can't possibly know my reasons. And you can't ask me. And if you could, I would probably lie to you, like, in 50% of cases. And you couldn't possibly know that, either.

Thus, all things considered, here are my suggestions:

- @Reddit staff: Keep it like it is. Keep it *simple*. 

- @Reddit users: If you wanna mod something up, *just mod it up*. And if you wanna mod something down, then *just mod it down*. Whatever the reason. And if you don't want to vote at all, then *just don't vote*. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.

Heck, the rules are so simple! Why in Heaven's name do we always try to make things complicated?
Shouldn't this be left to the bloggers or the blogging software? I think I've seen it done before.
So what is Virtualization Service Architecture? Well something that will be the norm tomorrow.

granted a lot of that video comes off as being 'cool', and the music doesn't help that impression. but i can see the possibilities, especially when the user is navigating through images and resizing windows. it looks quicker, and more accurate. you effectively have multiple mouse pointers which are your fingers, so can communicate more to a computer than with a traditional one mouse situation, like touch screens and tablet pcs. we aready communicate our intentions with gestures of our hands and fingers anyway, so it's not the gestures that are new in this video. but the gestures in this video don't go though a proxy of hardware. i think i could work much quicker with an interface like that.
oh, ps) where's the ajax? (joke)
The point of a rant isn't to tell people something they didn't already know; the point is to get them upset enough to do something about a problem they *are* already aware of.
This site and these authors are great, if you like historical fiction. They are masters of the art. Check out the site. They also have blogs and you can sign up on their blog list. It is awesome!
Both. There would not be enough content in an Irish language reddit to justify it's existance. Better to have them all in one subreddit.

Hopefully reddit will get more and more popular. More and more links will be submitted, the new queue will get larger and larger.

People who spend time going through the new queue and promoting/demoting them should be rewarded somehow. Currently reddit only increases your karma if you submit popular links, thereby making links available for the rest of the reddit community. But if someone ranks 20 sites on the new queue, they have done a service to the reddit community and should likewise be rewarded.

Perhaps the karma increase should depend on the score of the link 1 week after it was posted. This would prevent people from karma-whoring by promoting all the links in the new queue.
&gt;So be aware that the pro-abortion crowd does include those who are willing to terminate infant life, even if it is legally so defined.

Yes, and the pro-life crowd includes those who are willing to terminate doctor's lives, if they are willing to perform abortions.  I don't see how pointing to the more radical ideas of others contributes to your debate with rsheridan.
pretty neat. looks like they were inspired by 'minority report' amongst others. i think graphical designers and globe trotters would like it, but doesn't seem too useful for regular software development, writing a term paper, etc. I'd rather like to see a device that can automagically transmit thoughts in the brain to the screen in an intelligent manner. Now that would be cool!

I'm with you on that one.  You don't notice how artificial they actually look until you can compare the original.
Yes and yes. And maybe. Yeah, transparency is almost always pointless. If everything is visually complex, all transparency does is make that worse - and often make it unclear what's on top. Low-complexity things like a shell is probably the most I'd want transparent.

But it definitely can't hurt to make this possible. People will figure out what is and isn't useful. Macs' expose would not have happened without the ability to *do* it. 

Some nice touches, like the desaturation of paused programs. The multi-desktop detail is pretty nice too - the quick visual feedback in switching would help me remember where I put things, the live view in the alt-tabbing can prevent some unnecessary trying to find things by looking at everthing.

Tonight though, NBC Nightly News aired the story "Too many I's on the Olympic Team?" and echoed my sentiments exactly (really exactly!). In fact, NBC's story identified the exact same four athletes and cited the exact same lack of "team" spirit that I mentioned. I guess that is somewhat satisfying - now if only I get NBC to pay up for stealing my story...

i find your question most odd. it seems to indicate to me that you're either splitting hairs into four equal slices, or you're trying to get into a graduate course in philosophy, and i can't tell which is more likely true.

but then, i am very distracted at the moment. somebody reddited an OCR'ed (and likely quite illegal) copy of *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* a few days ago, and ever since i've been unable to quit pondering questions like "what is good". it's a great book, but don't pick it up if you're in any hurry at all...

maybe you're seriously asking us to define what "good" means in the context of humankind. if so, i salute you. but then again, maybe you're just kvetching about animal testing and using a seriously troublesome metaphysical issue as a brickbat, in a most mindless fashion. if so, i have wasted too much effort on you already. but which is it?
Actually, you are advocating torture. Those "fuzzy bunnies" will suffer extreme pain in some cases. You just feel the torture could result in an increase in the quality of human life; therefore, in your eyes, it is worth performing.

I no longer can comfortably say that I value human life more than animal life. I also can no longer comfortably say that animals are a resource for human beings to use.

we are speciesist because we cannot otherwise survive.

are there any other encyclopedias you'd like to have condensed into bumper-sticker format in a hurry?
Design methodologies that use some randomness to search the design space is NOT a good example of biological evolution. Design processes are DESIGNED with a PURPOSE in mind. They operate in carefully controlled environments. The theory of evolution postulates no intervention by an intelligent designer and no purpose.

When search spaces are large, intelligence techniques often use elements of randomness. This does not make the process as a whole random. 

To illustrate, a doctor may treat a patient by narrowing down the list of possible ailments, and then "randomly" assigning treatments, until a treatment is successful. This is different from randomly selecting medications from a pharmaceutical catalog. 

Another example, when trying to make a proof, a mathmatician may "randomly" try different approaches. But this is different from giving 100 monkeys pencils and paper and waiting for a monkey to produce the proof.

Examples of artificial selection to produce new breeds of animals or plants likewise do not provide any support for evolutionary theory. Artificial selection is no more a natural process than medical diagnosis, theorum proving, or circuit design. 

The key problem involved in complex design is that there are many more ways to do something wrong, than to do something right. Any purely random, unguided process will, long term, fail to consistently do the right things necessary to produce good design.

Natural selection being a natural process does not produce complex design. Rather, natural selection just describes a way to characterize mutations. When a mutation very much degrades an organism's ability to survive, then that organism fails to survive. This does not mean that the surviving organisms are in anyway "improved". They too are experiencing random mutations, which on the whole, are degenerative. But not so degenerative that they fail to survive to the next generation.

I see the history of life not as a triumphal march of evolution, but rather a bitter fight with devolution. The processes controlling life's information (DNA) are redundant and very reliable. They appear to be be designed to rezist the corruption caused by random mutations. Neverthess, it is hard to hold off entropy indefinitely. The information encoded into life at creation is slowly being destroyed.

Among humans there are many random mutations in our genetic information. Most of the time, at least for now, these changes are not noticable, because there exists "good copies" of the information which overide the bad. But over time (hopefully a long time) mutations will continue to accumulate and genetic diseases will be more common. 

Modern technology has helped lesson the effects of our decline. Where would we be without penicillin and its derivitives? Without eyeglasses? Without our systems of raising food? Without our abilities to generate and harness enormous energy to provide light, heat, and transportation? I think we would be feeling more evidence of our decline as a species, and we would talk less of evolution.
The former - it is a very difficult question to answer when you consider that animals feel pain like we do. 

My brother just finished his PhD in chemistry and is now working in the pharm. industry. Just the other day he told me how some of his compounds were promoted to dog testing and that a few of the dogs died.

It bothered both of us - especially since we both have dogs that we consider part of the family.

there is such a thing called "testing on people". It's called "clinical trials" and it's a multibillion dollar industry.
Subjects must sign an informed consent before they enter the trial.
Of course, I'd rather sign for a trial after the drug/device has been tested for safety on animals. This usually involves two different species, one of them usually a rodent (eg lab rats) and the other a non-rodent mammal (eg monkey).
It's been fun reading so many comments from people who do not realize the *agony* of working on this, and having to administer a drug or plug a device to an animal - - attenuated only by the hope of it helping bring about therapies for colon cancer, Parkinson's, you name it.
Excuse me, why on earth do we think animal rights activists are the bad guys? I understand some groups are militant, but I'm not sure why the rest of the world should align ourselves together against the very people who spend their lives trying to make it better for those with no voice. I hope everyone who made a comment here seriously checks every bottle of shampoo, moisturiser, lipstick, hairspray, sunscreen, foundation, toothpaste etc etc for the explicit 'NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS' statement. You are very wrong to think cosmetics companies are irrelevant. Procter and Gamble, Johnson and Johnson and all the big names test frequently on animals. I have asked them myself, the reason you may be misguided on this is that the law does not ask them to label their products. Propoganda against environmentalists, animal rights organisations and anyone who gives a hoot about the world is pumped out so people feel GOOD about bashing down those trying to help. Maybe instead of raving on about how activists are the biggest threat to the world, the guy in the article may have told us some of the information about animal testing that universities and other major organisations try so hard to hide. Then at least we can make an informed choice instead of voicing our ill-informed support of things we know nothing about.

His articles raise some interesting topics, but I tend to take  what he says with a fairly large grain of salt.
&gt; This man lives in the most prosperous corner of the most prosperous society humankind has ever produced

I had thought this referred to the US specifically rather than the whole industrialised world so it seemed to be worth considering Italy (which I think along with Spain offers the best life all-round), because they have a lively debate about creeping Americanisation destroying their quality of life. (I mentioned medieval living in passing really in reference to the idea that you lose something for each thing you gain.)
it can't be as simple as just the capacity for pain, though, no matter what Peter Singer may think. because if that was all there was to it, we could simply sever all of an animal's sensory nerves -- remove its ability to experience pain -- and then it'd be a-okay to treat it any which way we pleased. that can't be right, either.

animal testing bothers me, too, but i also know that if it weren't for it, we'd lack a lot of medical knowledge that has not only saved human lives, but saved animal lives as well. veterinary medicine tends to leech off of human medicine in fairly short order, after all. those lives we've saved can't be valueless or unimportant, because if so, then so would the lab animals' lives be.

some might say, then, that we should use carefully controlled animal testing (even if it means pain for the subject animals) in order to minimize overall suffering on the part of everybody. but that's simple utilitarianism, which i'm deeply allergic to; Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World* inoculated me against that philosophy a long time ago.

in truth, there are no simple, straightforward answers to questions this thorny. that's a large part of why i disagree with the animal rights activists; their answer is too simple, too pat. i think the question is too big to have such a small answer.
I first read about Avvenu on Russell Beattie’s blog a couple of months ago.  In his blog entry, Russell looks at Orb, SoonR and Avvenu for remote-access services and ends up selecting Avvenu. Read his blog for more details on how he ends up picking Avvenu, which he describes as the easiest, simplest, yet most useful of all the services.  Since I’ve had mixed results with a combination of remote-desktop, VNC, CVS and other solutions, I decided to give Avvenu a shot.
&gt;Excuse me, why on earth do we think animal rights activists 
&gt;are the bad guys?

because they destroy, terrorize, and threaten to kill, *and then they claim that **they're** the good guys*. that is deeply sick.

misunderstand me right, i know that violence is sometimes the only answer, and that it can be a necessary tool in certain situations. just don't be like the loony ALFers and pretend that violence doesn't damn well *hurt people*. even al quaeda knows better than that.
A computer program is intelligent to the degree that it's programmer was intelligent. A computer is simply a tool. Just like paper and pencil are tools. If the circuit was designed using paper and pencil, would you call the design unintelligent, because a paper and pencil are insentient? Of course not. :)

Perhaps all intelligent, guided processes can be thought of as methods to increase the probability of a desired result. A great example of this is cheating at a casino. Casino games are designed to make money for the casino over time by giving the house an advantage in the odds. Whenever someone consistently wins over the house, even if these winnings are are relatively small and well distributed, casino security is suspicious. It's just too unlikely that someone's "lucky streak" can consistently defy the laws of statistics. The more likely explanation is that the winner is using some purposeful, intelligent method to shift the odds in his favor, even by a few percentage points. Enough to give her the statistical edge.

As I understand it, nature is like a casino, constantly increasing its entropy. Constantly breaking things down. The only way to beat the house is to cheat by using an intelligent, guided process. Engineers obviously do this for a living, but everyone does this. Everytime you clean your desk, take a shower, or do any of the many little things you do to keep yourself and surroundings in good working order you are "cheating" nature, putting off the disorder that comes naturally.

Nature is not a friendly force helping everything evolve. It is the enemy, a destructive force slowly and relentlessly destroying everything. It doesn't even have the creative force to keep your room clean; much less cause a dirty puddle to evolve into the diversity of life we see around us.

What would happen if an American published one of these writers on their freely available blog? If they got arrested it would make a huge ruckus all over the media, because, you know, blog. And free speech online.
The "problem" of photoshopping in magazines is overhyped.

If you belive body-image problems stem from impossible ideals created in photoshop, watch TV and music videos instead of reading magazines - no photoshopping of models is taking place, but somehow I doubt that solves anything, at least with a magazine you can tell yourself it isn't real.

On a slightly unreleated note, an advantage with photoshopping still images is anybody can get this done, you don't have to be a magazine model.
The space could go one character sooner, too. How many meanings does dirty have, anyway?
This is a footnode - I didn't want it in the original post, (and reddit has no markup capability in that area).

I realise music videos etc are heavily computer processed, but to compare that to the kind of photoshop edits that people complain about here would be disingenuous.
The notes could be taken out of context. Perhaps Rumsfeld was covering all bases. Right after the Oklahoma Federal building bombing people immediately blamed Islamic extremist when if fact it was a domestic terrorist. After all Saddam did try to have Bush Senior assassinated. Conceivably they could have been behind 9/11.
As far as I can see we're all off track. Making abortion illegal does in no way stop abortion, it just increases the chances of the mother dying too through unsafe abortions. Basically making abortion illegal achieves nothing but more pain and deaths, regardless of any morals.
I disagree.  If someone makes an ass of themselves, they should not be able to "make it disappear" at the click of a mouse.

If they edit their original post, asking their repliers for forgiveness and for deletion of the replies, and they comply; fabulous.  Otherwise, let people live with the consequences of their posts.
How about making the reward just ridiculously low?

0.01 points of karma per article vote.  That's a 100 clicks per point.

Assuming the person actually posts, this would not give them any unfair advantages easily (after all every time you post you "tempt" karma loss, or karma gain).
You can't imagine a company maximizing their profit, by limiting the quality of their service to lower cost since there isn't any real competition, because they have the advantage of being a natural monopoly?
I guess I won't feel so bad the next time I mess up my tax return.
Its a very different supreme court we have now than in 1971.

Nice, like how they're looking backwards while they're walking forwards :)
The rules are simple if you are only looking at the "Hot" page or "Top" page. They aren't so simple when you are trying to use the recommendation page. I think that is the base of this arguement.

Think about it, if there was no recommendation page, the only way votes could be interpreted is as this article will be moved up in the rankings (for, as you said, whatever personal reasons the user has).

If there was only a Recommended page, however, you would be actively trying to train reddit to give you *quality* links of *relevant* links. Something different from moving up the link for everybody.

I think they should keep reddit the same if they choose ONE of these options, but I don't think they want to do that because the real innovation is in the recommended page. Now, maybe there is a way they can do pattern finding on clicks + comments as well as votes, as long as the "hot" page is the default people will associate up and down with finding whats good for OTHER people, not whats finding relevant to them.

It is a very interesting question.
Of course, it's for testing the machine.  How could you trust a scanning machine without testing it with anything?

And the kind of quality difference you get from the pros is like night and day. Fine feature definition, dual layer, plated vias, silk screened insulation and labels... Yeah. Don't even think about doing your own boards for digital electronics.
They could be taken out of context, but given everything we know...do you really think so? Read the Woodward book for more inside scoop. As for OKC there is still unknown accomplices out there, the sketch of john doe #2 was not just someone's imagination. And, the Bush Senior assassination plot has raised serious questions not least of them being the case against the accused has been thought of as seriously flawed.

As for your last idea, Saddam was NOT behind 9/11.
I'm not really sure what your point is... is it that photoshop itself doesn't cause the problem?  Well, of course it doesn't. Even without photoshop, we're already seeing a far greater percentage of beautiful people than is realistic, through music videos, TV, etc.  I don't think anyone's saying it's only an issue because of photoshop.  It's how we use it-- to intensify the unreality of the beautiful people we're already seeing in the media.

Also, judging from the popularity of this link, I would guess that it's not so easy for people to tell when it's real.  Otherwise, why would we be so fascinated by a site that exposes the photoshopping?
it was interesting to see who was NOT in the list! (Microsoft!!, Oracle, etc.)
It's because of the difference between burst bandwidth and sustained bandwidth.  Everyone agrees that it is good to be able to have a high burst rate on your connect.  This means that when you have to use a lot of bandwidth, you can do it.  But the definition of a burst is that it doesn't occur all the time.  When you sign up for a 5MB down / 1MB up Internet connection, you have to understand what you're really buying.  If you buy a business Internet connection then you can expect these to be sustained rates of data transfer.  For a home Internet connection, these should be treated as burst rates.

The reason for this distinction is economics.  The function of an ISP is to spread the cost of an upstream connection over many customers.  The ISP actually pays a lot of money for its connections to the major backbone providers.  Their job is to keep everyone's latency low and to do that they must purchase extra bandwith to meet the data transfer load.  With the advent of BitTorrent, ISPs are faced with a problem of dramatically increased bandwidth consumption.  They must either throttle the consumption or buy more bandwidth and pass the cost on to the consumer with higher prices.

It's hard to raise prices.  ISPs already offer two classes of connection: business and home.  A 1.1Mbit SDSL business connection will push 115KB/s up and pull 115KB/s down simultaneously sustained.  Home connections are much cheaper and rightly have poorer service.  Home connections in the USA are quite inexpensive considering that American residential areas are so large and require significant infrastructure maintenance.  It is invalid to compare USA Internet prices with those of Japan and South Korea because those countries have population density that is far higher than the USA.  Population density translates into customer density.  Increased customer density changes the economics of the infrastructure, allowing better services to be offerred for lower prices.  Until the advent of BitTorrent, most customers enjoyed business-connection service on their cheap home connection.  With the increase in consumption, the ISPs must throttle the home connection in some manner.  It's a matter of physics and economics.

In my opinion, ISPs should determine their traffic scheduling algorithm and publish it on their websites and advertisements.  This way the customer can know what he's buying.  This would eventually lead to ISPs offerring multiple service levels, differing not only in bandwidth but also in scheduling algorithms.

The article says that Sandvine's system limits the number of connections per customer.  I think that it would be better to limit the bandwidth of the customer rather than the number of connections.  The customer could then configure his file sharing app to decrease its bandwidth usage when making a VoIP call or playing a game.

Eventually we will have QoS scheduling deployed across the Internet.  Then our VoIP calls will be crystal clear despite an maxed pipe to the upstream provider.  The ISPs will drag there feet on this while they're trying to make money on their own VoIP systems.  It may take government regulation to get them to support the QoS standards that will emerge soon.

My girlfriend's school prohibits wifi even though they have no wifi network of their own, and thus no wireless connection to screw up. If they don't want to *support* any student's wifi device, that's fine.

I suspect that their actual problem is that they don't have a switched network, and everyone is on private IP addresses (10.2.x.x) so if someone plugs in the wrong end of their router (&amp; thus DHCP server), everyone in the building gets fucked.

The obvious solution is to bless (with or without support) a particular brand/model wifi device that has no incorrect ethernet port to plug in, for example the Airport Express. But they won't do that because they are too busy being self righteous about what students do with "*my network*".

Another excellent essay.  I have an issue with one of the foot notes, however.

When you comment on peoples beliefs of how things are being clouded by the way they wish things were, and that religion is the best index of that, I have to disagree.

My experience with the best examples of people of faith is that their faith is often confirmed by experience.  Having personally witnessed what some people call miracles, I find it hard to deny the existence of something beyond the full reduction of science, but I often wish that it was not so.
Something outside myself also places bounds on my personal freedom, although it can give some of the guidance you write about.

I'd guess that even you'd have to admit that they way you wish things were has a strong impact on the way things will be, and so it may not be as black and white as your footnote makes it out to be.

Supposedly this is about DRM lock-in, but after I read the title, I kept reading this post as "you suckers paid for mp3s you could have downloaded for free."
All great technological advances appeared previously in fiction.  Whether this was "inspired by Minority Report" or not has nothing to do with its usefulness and applicability to contemporary interface problems.  Saying that it won't be useful for regular software is like saying that the mouse wouldn't be useful for regular software.

My immediate goal in life is to make computers like they are in the movies and books.  Do computers ever crash in the movies?  Only when it's part of the plot.  Logging in to a remote machine gives you a cool 3D interface... over dialup.  People use software instantly, without making mistakes... "it's a unix system... I know this!"  Search engines converse with you.  Software responds to your mood.  Buying and selling stuff is easy, not requiring a credit card.  You can pay a stranger for work done online, without risk.  Your data and software is accessible to you at any time, from any terminal (including your mobile).

Within 30 years I expect the computers of today to be replaced by teriminals.  Software will run on server farms in datacenters.  It will be accessed through cheap terminals with multi-input touchscreens and 3D stereo displays.  Nothing will be permanently stored in a terminal.  By that time I may need glasses, barring advances in opthalmology.  I hope the glasses will correct my vision and also provide terminal functionality:

* 3D stereo projection into the eyes
* spatial audio recording and playback (without earbuds)
* high definition camera recording in all directions, in a wide frequency range that includes infrared, maybe also backscatter RF
* input via body movement and manipulation of lightweight handheld devices
* attention awareness by monitoring eye focus
* health monitoring (detect bloodpressure fluctuations by measuring changes in veins of the eye, etc.)

And using these glasses, I'll be able to use NASA WorldWind v13.3 and control it with my hands, much like you see WorldWind 1.3 in the linked video. :)  The only difference is that I'll be able to zoom in to any non-classified spot on the globe and pay the equivalent of $1 per minute for realtime telepresense.  The groundlevel telepresense data won't come from space.  It'll come from many cameras and microphones that overlook the area.  The multiple video feeds will be converted in realtime into a stream of 3D video, allowing me to navigate through the real world as if it were a 3D game.  The $1/min will go to pay the owners of those cameras and to pay for the processing and streaming of the data to my terminal, my glasses.
Indeed it is.  I was writing based on my own memory; Phil probably had transcripts.  Either way, his is more well written.
I don't understand anyone's concern over having your email address in the URL.  Have you never heard of "throwaway" email addresses?  Make a new one!  Make another one if you don't like that one.

I mean, it's not like invites are rare.  I have 10 gmail accounts, and 1000 invites (as I'm sure most gmail users have), so it's not like you have to use your primary account in the URL.

The editor is bogus though.  Geocities, except you can't edit the entire html of the document.
It should be a 303.  302 is for resource redirection whereas a 303 implies that the original request isn't done being fulfilled.  A 303 is also supposed to be fetched regardless of the cache.
It is a bit lengthy, but I think there's a lot of value in understanding HTTP better.  Just doing a header("Location: uri") in php isn't necessarily all you should be doing.  It all depends on the context.

Anyway at the airport guards are very polite, though they ask some semi-personal question - have youp packed your luggadge yourself, had anyone asked you to take some items for him etc. They also are not causing slowdown - there is enough of them (in airport I mean, in other places they causing long lines usually).

I like reddit the way it is at the moment.  Therefore I thought at first: well,
maybe you are right, keep everything like it is now, it seems to work somehow.
Does it matter why it works in particular?  Probably not.

But reddit wont stay like it is now.  Even if not one single
bit of the software is going to be changed.  The reason is that the users of
reddit change.  In particular the number of them.  Why's that a problem you may
ask.  It's because reddit is at the moment de facto about casting votes for the 'best' article.  Now: we know that voting is about finding a consensus,
something as much as possible people can agree with.  And the more participants
there are in this process the less candidates remain.  Maybe I'm brain-washed by
[Ray Kurzweil](http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/327/) but it seems that the growth
of the number of users could be exponential and that probably means that variety   may vanish pretty fast and the main topic of reddit will converge to the one and
only: Apple

The zillions of articles about Apple are the reason why slashdot bores me lately.  Actually there will be a second topic (Google?) so
that the democracy illusion will be preserved.  We know this pattern from nearly
every democratic state: you always have exactly two major parties which
essentially do not differ all too much.  The outcome is predictable: today      Apple, tomorrow Google, Apple, Google, ...  boring!

Ok, there's maybe a bit of exaggeration in the above-stated, but you get the
idea.  I really think it's not about choosing between leaving reddit as it is
now and trying to follow the trail to what seems to be the original goal of
reddit: being a personal topic filter.  Rather it's about the question whether
reddit will succeed in some way or develop into another boring and redundant geek newsticker -- which is to fail.

I might agree with you.  On all but one of the shots he made he had an opponent right in front of him, but its hard to see how hard the opponent was trying to block the shot.

I don't agree. Just look at men's competition. It was basically an "easy task" to win gold for Plushenko, one quad-triple-double combo, and then all the triples, not even need for another triple-triple combo. He won with the quality of his elements and because he did not have mistakes.

Joubert, on the other side went for 2 quads instead of just one of Plushenko, and ended up 7th in the free, because of making mistakes. Lysacek, with no quad at all had the 3rd best free skate.

Actually, I think, this system makes you play it safer... It's a shame that such people - who do not know way too much about figure skating and the judging system - write articles like this.
The fact that Paulos compares free markets and evolution shows he doesn't understand one or the other or both. The two cannot be compared because evolution postulates a purposeless, undirected process, while free markets are full of intelligent agents whose purpose is to direct their efforts to offering better deals.

Just to quickly weigh in again, I tend to agree with tmalsburg, as noted. And he's right, we have extra information for training what we're interested in by what we clicked.
So a new suggestion: *one* extra button -- something like 'undo' for clicking. Or 'spammed!' or something. So clicks normally train your filter, arrows indicate quality (and perhaps an up arrow an extra point for your filter, but whatever, we (the users) don't have to know), and a _boink_ button for when we feel we were suckered into clicking, and don't want the link included in our filter.

Of course, having no idea how the filter works to actually correlate articles, I don't know how reasonable the whole thing is. I *do* know that I don't tend to use the recommended page that much because the hot page seems to give me more of what I want. Which is a bit counter-intuitive.

Should this be a feature of reddit? :)

greit at det hovedsaklig skal være norske linker, men da vil du få en evig loop av drit fra vg og db.no, og poenget er jo å finne nyheter og sider man ellers ikke ville funnet, eller?
If you think US democrats are left your view is obviously distorted by the lack of a real left in the US.
Assuming that you have selected the pref "don't show sites after i've disliked them", which I believe is the default, you can just vote them down and they'll disappear.

At first I didn't want to do this, because I have no inherent objection to the idea of (for example) "türkçe reddit", and in fact I think it's a good idea, so I didn't really want to vote them down.

But then I realized that people who speak Turkish can easily find the Turkish reddit no matter how many or how few points  it has - *especially* if they also filter out the language subreddits that they're not interested in.
Also, I should mention that I'm just offering this as a current workaround to the clutter - I'm *not* saying that the idea of grouping language subreddits into a different category is a bad one.  In fact, I think it's a good idea, and I will be voting this suggestion up.
Dang... I wish I could delete my [previous submission](http://reddit.com/info?id=28bk). I was searching around for why no Linux distros parallelize startup, and I found this in a forum. Well, at least the previous article has some good explanations.

I hope this matures and gets adopted soon, because the one thing I hate about Linux is bootup time :)

There's a music video out there for a band/guy named Kenna, and the song is called "Hell Bent," where he uses this video  for his song, and it fits pretty perfectly.  

Ah!  Here's a link: http://www.musicremedy.com/audio/285
The other team could have paid me money and I still couldn't have hit **ANY** of those shots.

i agree. the game was already out of hand when the kid was put in. i'm guessing the opposing coach told his kids to lay off a bit.
No, they should still be applauded. In fighting this extortion, they're setting a precedent for other high-tech companies. A precedent that says, "You don't actually need to pay these bastards; it's possible to oppose it in court."

Of course, at this point they've spent so much on the legal battle that it might have been cheaper to just buy off NTP. But that would only have put more money in the NTP coffers with which to terrorize other companies.

Browsing the new queue is a reward in itself, it's just a shame that so few people seem to do it. It's almost slightly sad to see something worthwhile slipping into obscurity, one feels like rescuing it with a more interesting headline.
One would think that seeing these have created such a big fuzz, they'd be published and widely awailable, but thats hardly the case. I spent 40 minutes looking for the drawings online, and finally found them... on a blog.

See 'em and laugh, have a fit or non of the above. But DO see them.
Jeg synes dette var en god sak!

Poenget er ikke å hindre artikler fra kjente sider som VG og Dagbladet å vises. Ikke alle gidder å lese de avisenes nettsted og da er det greit å få frem gode artikler man gikk glipp av hos dem.

I mine øyne er det fine med reddit at man får en kontinuerlig oppdatert liste over gode artikler UAVHENGIG av hvor de ble publisert. Enten det er fra norges mest leste nettsted, eller fra en liten blogg som bare en håndfull leser.

Hele poenget med løsninger som reddit forsvinner hvis man rakker ned på alt. Gi poeng til det du selv lker å lese om. Ignorer det du ikke liker og begrens de negative poengene til spam og annet som ikke hører hjemme her.

Given that we know how many points a link has accumulated, we could tell more about its quality if we also knew how many times the link had been followed. EG Something with 30 points, and 200 clicks, might be less interesting/worthwhile then something with only 9 points but 10 clicks. Frankly I don't have a clue. Except that reddit is rather good in it's current incarnation.
great comment halfway down...

*...by the way, if someone makes it a point to embarrass you because of a speech impediment, consider learning the computer programming language we call LISP to eventually attain so much skill and ability that you are worth a great deal of money, then leverage your value to start your own business and become so successful that you have amassed an even greater and unspeakable amount of money so that you might lobby your respective country's politicians to create and pass obscure legislation that practically gurantees the doom and misfortune of the specific people who taunted you all along. An alternative means to this end may include any combination of a woodchipper, a chainsaw, 10,000lbs(pound) anvil(Acme brand), dangerous out-of-state illegal fireworks and pyrotechnics, or **trained seahorse assasins** [sic]...*
Oh sure, the theatrics aren't usually this bad because everyone's pretty much used to being treated like cattle by now. I flew out of Denver yesterday for a trip to Florida. Security was a pain in my ass, not because the people treated me poorly (they were tired but "robotic" -- no rudeness, but no humanity either), but because of what I had to actually *do* to get through security without a big hassle.

Take off my jacket, put it in a bin. Take out my notebook and video camera from my (probably overpacked) backpack. Put them in a bin. Take off my shoes, put them in a bin. Empty my pockets, put their contents in a bin.

All told, I sent *four* bins and a bag through their scanner, and walked through the metal detector without shoes, all so my fellow travellers could feel somehow "safer" now that we all knew I wasn't carrying a bomb or a weapon?

Oh, and yes, they are quite fond of yelling and scolding; at Denver International at least, passengers are herded into a single long line for ID/boarding pass checks, which feeds into the security screening lines. If you don't have your ID and boarding pass ready, you get scolded. If you don't pay full attention and stand in line like a good little citizen and don't notice the second or third ID checker in the background calling you forward, you get scolded.
Is this supposed to have any sound?
I can't help but notice that the story is over a year old.I wonder what's happened with this in the meantime. Did Richard Seaver and Arcade go ahead with those Iranian stories, and what happened as a result?

Speaking of Paris Hilton, I wish someone would do an after of this http://nsfw.reddit.com/info?id=1no3 (nsfw).
I'd guess that most of us have seen retouched images (in every magazine we've ever read), and we've seen unretouched images (all over Flickr, every time we see a relative's slide show or photo album, etc.). But we've never seen a retouched image right next to its original, where we can easily compare just *how much* it's getting retouched.

"Not to mention that the top orange is warped."

Exactly. You're not just seeing a thong because "you have a dirty mind"; you're seeing a thong because someone in the *Brazilian* Tourism Board's advertising department was deliberately making a visual pun.

I't snot just the viewer's mind that makes these images dirty; it's also the dirty minds of the artists who designed them.

Hmm. I was thinking about your argument, first and foremost about what Ray Kurzweil and [Kevin Kelly](http://www.kk.org/outofcontrol/) had to say, trying to figure things out. 

Then, all of a sudden, the following question hit me right in the face:

What if leaving out gimmicks and featuritis is the best method to *keep stupid kiddies out*? 

What if *adding* even a single feature/popup/tooltip/matrix (however useful and however seamlessly implemented) actually *helps attract* myriads of new users which we would rather prefer not to attract?

As I was saying, I love the simplicity of a binary choice. Stupid kiddies don't. They are not attracted by ascetism. They love all things blinking, singing, dancing and Web-3.1-ing. 

I believe in simple binary choices because I believe in the [Hive Mind](http://reddit.com/info?id=21ds), aka the Wisdom of Crowds. Stupid kiddies don't believe in either, cause they don't read no st00pdi books OMG LOL pselling is for douchebags!!

Bottom line: if we don't want to become the next Slashdot or Digg, then *why* would we want to mimic them in any way or manner? 

Look, there's a huge gap between the voting system of Reddit and, say, Slashdot. But I consider that a feature, not a bug. I think that's by design, not by coincidence. 

Why don't we consider the possibility that our primitive, OMG-so-st00pid voting system is one of the main reasons why Reddit != Slashdot? 

And if the gap between "us" and "them" is closing, we shouldn't strive to close it even faster ourselves, should we? 

As far as I'm concerned, I'm no fan of sawing off the branch I'm sitting on.
A couple of years back, I was reading Lisp In Small Pieces at my in-laws'.  A relative of a relative got very interested and started asking me questions about it.  I was surprised since I didn't even know that he programmed.  After a minute or two, my wife realized the truth of the situation and broke in to mention that the Lisp I was reading about was a programming language.  You see, the fellow I was talking to is a speech therapist.  He was just as surprised that I was reading about lisps as I was that he cared.

Part of what was funny about it was how many words we shared but which had subtly different meanings.  "interpreter", "syntax", "semantics", "symbols", etc.  I was able to confuse him pretty badly without even trying.

Good point, neither my brother nor I have children. I have been told on many, many, occasions that having children "changes everything." But, until then (which won't be too long, I just got engaged) - I am not as comfortable with the issue as you seem to be.



lynxcat73, that was a great answer, thank you. I am going to read up on this issue some more, back-and-forth multi-line arguments on a message board - even if it includes the intelligent people who visit reddit - do not do this subject justice.

And Shirin Ebadi's memoir is going to press:

Yes! Don't watch it if you don't get any sound, the music is like the best part. :)
Hitting shots is not the fundamentally difficult part of basketball.  It just takes practice.

The fundamentally difficult part is getting open, or hitting shots while well-guarded.
Sounds like what Mac OS X already does.
I take your point. That looks like a dilemma. 

However, I don't think that it *is* a dilemma. I honestly think that at the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

Let me explain.

As I was saying on several previous occasions, I believe in the so called Hive Mind, or the Wisdom of Crowds. I believe in what 
[Kevin Kelly](http://reddit.com/info?id=21ds) and [Clay Shirky](http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html) had to say. (I highly recommend that you take a minute to follow these links.)

In other words, if we were only two users here, then yes, I could seriously harm you by not using the system in the same way as you. But as long as we are many, all irregularities will just be ruled out.

Thus, I think, what each of us should do is just figure out how he/she *personally* wants to use the system. And then just use it that way. And it will work.

If you would love to use the Recommended page, then just vote accordingly. If you prefer using the Top page, then just vote accordingly. If you want to mod down each and every article submitted by user X just because he called you a douchebag in a comment, then just do it. 

It doesn't matter. The system will work. It will work for you -- *and* it will work for everyone else. 

You just have to follow your own interests. Noone can control you anyway. Noone can coerce you into doing anything but what you were going to do anyway.

Now wait, hold on. Think about it. I am *not* saying that you must be a complete egoist.

What I'm saying is that you must be a complete egoist *if you want to*. If you want to be a complete altruist instead, then just be a complete altruist. If you want to be something in between, *just be it*. If you want to be an egoist today and an altruist tomorrow, just act accordingly. 

If you wanna post the greatest articles ever, post them. If you wanna spam, then spam. If you wanna be a karma whore, be a karma whore. If will all even out. 

Just don't spend too much time trying to figure out the community's needs. Because there is no such thing as the community's needs. Each and every one of us has (slightly or greatly) different needs anyway. And you can't change it. We're humans, not clones. 

You can try to serve everyone, but only to fail. You can try to be the Jack of all trades, but you'll just end up being the master of none.

Bottom line: just go out and do whatever is best for *you*. Heck, that's how *everything* works on this planet -- economics, politics, fashion, you name it.
[deleted]
that is amazing
The "send lots of heavy junk back with a prepaid envelope" thing doesn't work.  US Postal Service rules allow such things to be treated as trash; they do not deliver and charge.

Just send the envelope back empty instead.  It *will* be delivered, and the company *will* be charged.  And if everybody did this, it would be a significant hit to the average profitability of such unwanted commercial mass mailings.

Here's a [Straight Dope article](http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_356.html) on the topic.

Hmmm, kinda spendy, but looks really cool.  I am kind of skeptical of how well it can work.  I'd really like to hear if someone has tried one.
This is old and is already implemented in linux.  I am using it right now.
Enough about Lisp! Do all articles about Lisp automatically make the Hot list? How about starting lisp.reddit.com for this stuff? Not that Lisp isn't cool, but honestly...
I Think the stuff in his belly is passion.  Does anyone else agree?
Oops :) [Who has the power to delete stuff like this when it happens?] Better yet, the submission form should check for a valid URI/keyword self &amp; valid anchor text.
Agreed. On top of that, this piece is just fluff. A claim like "Lisp is the most important idea in computer science" needs to be justified, but this article fails to do so.
The funny thing is, that people on #lisp (freenode) get very upset whenever someone mentions reddit. It's just called "the r word" there.

Overly dramatic title here, but yeah, pretty damn good.
Oh yes, he's gotta know how to "take me places I've never gone before."
Hmm... I like the original better - it's more dramatic, less emo:)
I noticed that too.  I'm glad someone looked into that
But he's just talking about taping your reply card to a brick.

Taping it to a well-packed box sounds like it would work great.
Another perfect example of the main american problem: not recognizing they have faults like everyone else.

At least me and most people I know (in Germany) don't see every action of our Government as perfectly correct. We know we have only very limited control over our "democratic" government. Americas problem is "patriotism", blind faith in your own Government that is almost unknown here in Germany after the events of the Third Reich.
This seems like a lot of work for not really that much fun.
Really? I vaguely recall seeing it called that once in the [logs](http://meme.b9.com/cdates.html?channel=lisp), but thought it was a joke. Does anyone there get seriously flamey about it?

Though, if you start asking whether something in Lisp is as good as its Scheme counterpart...

Incidentally, people should see the Scifi channel's Battlestar Galactica forums when someone calls the show "GINO"...
I figured it was soul
Incredible.
I've flown El Al twice.  They have effective security, not sham security (as practiced by the TSA).  El Al relies heavily on human and psychological factors instead of  relying solely on technology.  Basically, they ask you several questions trying to trip you up.  I must say, however, I did not find the El Al security screen any worse than the US TSA thing (where you almost have to disrobe and then re-dress).  The TSA screen is more of a sham.  El Al doesn't waste time and resources on passengers who don't fall into certain profiles.
Agreed.  In case you can't make out the tiny text in the credits, the music is called "Elegia", by New Order, off the "Low-Life" album.

Actually, "Common Lisp The Speech Impediment" is the title of a post linked to from that post, which is titled "On Lisp On Line".  I guess there's some Google juice spillover.

http://lemonodor.com/archives/000474.html contains a completely different ad hoc community in its comments.  It's even got journalists trolling for stories.  (But at least the comments are in line with the topic of the post.)

The grand daddy of threads having nothing to do with the post subject, though, is http://lemonodor.com/archives/000520.html

761 comments, and I don't think a single one has to do with Lisp.  And yet hundreds of people had to answer the question "What is this weblog about?" in order to get their comment past my filters.

Join your online peer group at www.reddit.com.
Ok, in light of your above posts, I certainly see where you are coming from.  However, since I am logged in to the reddit system, I *could* be given an option in my preferences to 'use link click-throughs to train recommended filter', just like I already have the 'open links in a new window' option checked.  Not everyone likes the open in new window option, but unlike /. and digg, I *love* having that (simple) option here at reddit. 

Reddit staff, I propose the recommended page be amended to allow me, since I'm the only one that's going to see my stuff, to set how I want to allow that filter to be trained.

That way we have the best of both worlds, in that simplicity of reddit is by default maintained (e.g., Schwallex), while allowing advanced options for the rest of us (e.g., me, tmalsburg).


It's a lovely story. In a way, it shows how the passion and the commitment can go over the limits that sometimes we put ourselves in. Speaking more generally, the way how society see IQ is completely wrong, people can do amazing things independently from their IQ.
WOW! reversed video! I've never seen that before!!! :(
As with any analysis by a user who has long familiarity with one system and recently started using another, this one is flawed. It consistently plays up Subversion's strengths and downplays its weaknesses. For instance, transactional commits are "probably" an advantage and respository-wide versioning isn't even mentioned.

MORE Explained:
"The Academy-Award® nominated animated short-film tells the story of a lonely inventor, whose colorless existence is brightened only by dreams of the carefree bliss of his youth.

By day, he is trapped in a dehumanizing job in a joyless world. But by night, he tinkers away on a visionary invention, desperate to translate his inspiration into something meaningful.

When his invention is complete, it will change the way people see the world. But he will find that success comes at a high price, as it changes himself, as well."

I think the stuff in his belly is his creativity, his bliss,   his passion, his will of change, his soul.

Eric Veach! Sly boy. In 1997, a very little known PhD thesis by him was published, on an innovative rendering method that would offer physically accurate levels of rendering. That method is finally coming to a commercial setting in [Maxwell](http://www.maxwellrender.com/). That method has several other nicities, such as being basically immune to scene size (pretty much constant scaling wrt polygon count and light sources), and being almost perfectly parallel. He was snapped up by Pixar very soon after, and as far as I can find, didn't produce anything more in that area. The method used some very good statistical tools -- I basically learnt stats off the thesis. So he got hired by Google, eh? 

Cunning.
What a load of carp. See the "evidence" section of their website (http://www.loosechange911.com/) for a few examples: Larry Silverstein got terrorism insurance on his lease? A 1997 government reoprt on terrorism depicted the WTC in crosshairs?

Some awesome web developer who does this sort of thing please explain to me the logic behind deciding that you know how big my browser window should be better than I know.  Thanks.
A lot of the more interesting stuff is in the "oddities" section... http://www.loosechange911.com/oddities.htm
Things like conflicting reports about the black boxes surviving the crashes, but one of the hijacker's passports making it out of the WTC intact; the last three minutes of the Flight 93 voice recorder not working correctly; how many of the hijackers were reported as being alive post 9/11... very odd.
Of course, this article is assuming that one adopts the Biological Species Concept.  I find it interesting that they would take that as the definition of a species when there is no real agreement within the biological community.
I liked the Pistols.  John Lydon was a great singer, and the band made the '70s much more fun than would otherwise have been.  But there's a limit to how long one can run around posing as the Great Punk Originators and One True Rock Band. 

Maybe one day Lydon will pull his head out of ass and go back to making inventive music (a la early PiL).  

Meanwhile, who cares?  Unless, of cource, Malcom McLaren decides to show up and claim the award on their behalf.

(The Pistols are right, of course, about the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, but pointing out the obvious has always been their stock in trade, so no news there.)

heh. the system does work.

Uhhh ... my head ... hey who's been playing with the caps lock key? What am I doing here?
The article makes a fair point about software design.  Once the algorithm design is understood in plain English it is then described for the computer processor through a compiler which translates a language like C/Assembly/Scheme into binary form.

I have a problem with his method though.  If I wanted to translate something I wrote in English into Spanish the quickest way would be to translate it directly, assuming my command of the Spanish language was strong.  What if I found it easier to translate written French into Spanish easier than translating from English?  Would it be pertinent for me to translate my English to French?  Then my French to Spanish?  Maybe for me yes, but the vast majority would be faster in using only a single step.

A programmer strong in C should also program more efficiently if he/she writes the code without using an intermediate language.  Of course the point made about getting the algorithm correct before enhancing the performance can be good advice.  He essentially used Scheme to write high level pseudo-code of the algorithm for his C program.

If you fight more with a language like C to express code compared to other languages, you're not a C programmer.  If I were to program in Python I would need to struggle more with the language than I would with C.  My efficiency in implementing code in a language I am less familiar with will always be less.  In C I know the "best way" of doing things from experience for many given problems, in other languages I do not.  e.g. In Java I may not have known that StringBuffer is much faster than String class.  In C I know to append strings faster with len+=sprintf(message+len,...); ...a Java programmer may not have know the latter either.

Scheme is not faster than C except for the author at that point in time.

My apologies to those who don't have WSJ accounts.
I agree, too. How can one say that a programming language is the most important idea in computer science? And to justify it, he lists a couple of quotes about how great lisp is.

The way I see it, computer science is a bit more than this; one can not just chose a programming language as the "best idea".
&gt;I agree. Evidence doesn't do anything for those who don't understand basic logic and reasoning concepts ([[or don't want to understand]]).

That seems to be the problem. People can reason about things unrelated to what they believe, but the moment their belief appears to be contradicted... poof! reason is gone.

Do you have a web presence that you'd like to associate with your bigheadarmy nickname? Like, you know, a blog? Google doesn't abide.
No kidding. Although I do not smoke pot, I really don't understand why it hasn't been decriminalized. Someone spent 5 years making this bust....5 years of tax payer's money, and more tax money likely spent on the trial, then even more to cover prison costs. And the people he supplied with pot will just get it somewhere else. I believe the amount of crime/violence and wasted resources sacrificed in not decriminalizing pot far outweighs the negative ramifications of decriminalization. The fact is, we cannot singularize this morality, the net expense is too great. I applaud the states which have been passing decriminalization-bound legislation.

The problem is, Bill Clementson's blog is aimed at a Lisp-using audience, who presumably are acquainted with the whole discussion and have informed opinions pro/con. It's not aimed at a general audience.

As for Alan Kay's claim... there are at least 3 broad features in Common Lisp implementations which allow users to deal with code on a kind of "meta", second-order level: manipulation of code within data structures (during, say, compiletime), the [metaobject protocol](http://wiki.alu.org/Metaobject_Protocol), and the reader.

Is this terribly advanced? Depends on your perspective. Many earlier Lisp users seemed to assume that Common Lisp was just some politically-motivated codification of a few strains of Lisp, and would be naturally obsoleted with time. By that yardstick, we seem to be in the nightmare scenario.

Another perspective is that Lisp is the most advanced programming tool in existence, in some ambiguous overall sense.

(And of course, yet another perspective is that Lisp users are just another bloc of monkeys peddling snake oil, who've taken it in their heads to use tools of marketing in order to appeal to the business world. Whether or not one agrees with that argument, it's certainly a possibility to keep in mind. If Lisp is truly so good, it should stand up to rational scrutiny by reasonably openminded people. Problem is though, just as Alan Kay isn't hanging around websites all day answering questions, you probably won't get 100% satisfactory answers on usenet either.)
the width of the table is 770 pixels, so everyone with a resolution of 800 x 600 or higher should have little problem viewing it. that's around 97% of people, possibly higher http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp?output=print

Here in Vancouver. Alot of Veitnamese gangs are envolved in growing pot. The way the governemnt catches them is to simply look at the electricity bill. To circumvent this, most pot growers rent basements for a few month and move out as soon as the pots are harvested.

But the looks of this house in question. The investment must be huge. They can be caught very fast if they tap into the grid. I am guessing that they probably have their own generators.
Oh, please.

My screen is not 800x600 or less.  My screen is huge.  That is not the issue.

Not everybody keeps their browser window maximized, believe it or not.  Yet this page, and its ilk, wants to make sure that it surrounds its meager 770 pixels of content with as much blank space as my huge monitor will allow, so it invasively resizes my browser window to its maximum allowed size.

In Callifornia (and other places no doubt), industrial growers go off the grid and use generators to avoid being busted by their electricity bill.  Diesel is a lot harder to track, especially since there are lots of legit uses for large quantities of it.

I do not think Saddam was behind 9/11. I am merely stating that for the first few hour after the attack it was anyone's guess as to who was behind it. Sure most people believed it was Bin Laden and rightfully so, but still doesn't mean the government didn't consider other parties responsible. The missing accomplice from the OKC attack just strengthens my point that Rumsfeld wanted to find evidence fast for fear if there was a connection between Saddam and 9/11 it would disappear. I just don't understand how people think this administartion is so evil that all it wants is war. As miss guided as the Iraq was is I think Bush truly felt it was the right thing to do.
How could they have done anything else?

It's called init-ng.
Really? I've only had experience with Fedora (FC4) and SuSE in my college lab, and both run through boot one service at a time. I couldn't find any mention of parallelized booting in the [Ubuntu wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperGoals) or [Dapper specs](https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/dapper/+specstable) either.

I came across a tool called [initng](http://initng.thinktux.net/index.php/Main_Page) that does this properly, but it was started only last year and is still in beta. I doubt any distro is using it. What are you using, fbgreenglow?
As you say, it's in the USPS's interest to deliver bulk mail, because that's how they make a lot of their money.

In fact, that's why U.S. letter postage is so cheap:  it's subsidized by the sale of bulk mail permits.

So if you want to  get rid of bulk mail, go right ahead, but recognize that you'll be getting rid of cheap private mail at the same time.

Check the date of the article. I knew I'd heard of this somewhere.

My biggest concern would be disabling the paralell boot for troubleshooting purposes. You'd need some way to tell init to run one set of scripts instead of another. The author suggests that this should be easy, but I think that you'd be looking at, at best, a modified init.
Have you been to any teen forums? Most of them sound like that: a mixture of angst, cheerful mental laziness, and poor grammar.

I don't know whether that should make you less sad, or more.
The war on drugs is not meant to be won, and it's not meant to reduce drug use.  It's meant to trick people into thinking politicians are doing good things.  Same with gun control, the war on poverty, and every other government program.  Government programs are a way of consolidating government power, by doing something that looks good and making people think the government is necessary.  Appearance trumps substance.

Drug abuse is worse now that when the drug war was started.  Many people realize that it's stupid, but many others believe what the government tells them, that without the War on Drugs their kids will go to raves and do E.  Then they can sleep well, content that the government has taken over the responsibility of keeping their kids away from drugs.  While their kids go out to raves and do E.
Cool. Thanks.

I'm a web developer, but I can't explain to you why anyone does this. I sure as hell don't, and like Zak, I have my browser set to ignore attempts to do so. (If I could have my browser set to stab the developer in the face across the Internet, as disincentive to try such things in the future (a la http://bash.org/?4281), I might. Unfortunately, work on FSTVIP (Face-Stabbing Transport Via Internet Protocol) has been held up in IETF committees for years now.)

I could go on at some length about why force-maximizing a user's browser when they don't already have it maximized is both stupid and arrogant, but I can see I'd be preaching to the choir.

I thought what they were insinuating with the whole "cross hairs on the report" thing, was that the idea of a terrorist attack on the twin towers wasn't an alien concept to the government. Sort of a counter-argument to all the comments about it's "unexpectedness".

I don't program in C++ and don't really understand what he means by 'artificially hard'. I know that a big difficulty in C++ is properly managing
pointers, which in turn makes the runtime much faster than languages which abstract this process, like Java. So what else is so difficult about C++? And how
is C++ cryptic? The syntax is almost identical to that of Java, which I don't think many would consider 'cryptic'.  And aren't there areas where C++ is the only good choice, like scientific algorithms that must be blazingly fast and video games?

Michel de Montaigne: Essais (taz, 15.10.98) 
http://www.stephanmaus.de/rezension-montaigne.htm
I think this video is a must-see. I was skeptical for the first half-hour but it raised a few questions that I simply couldn't ignore and was converted to the point that I would really like some answers.

* The WTC building collapsed in free-fall time. No, it wasn't jet fuel making the steel weak and the whole thing buckling; even the NIST's investigations say that it wasn't that, and it was the subsequent ordinary fire being the reason. Steel can easily take that kind of heat. This isn't the first time buildings have caught fire, including WTC.

* There was gobs of molten steel at the base. Nothing, not even jet fuel would raise temperatures to melt steel. After all, the same engine has a massive combustion going on during normal operation, burning jet fuel for hours on end. There was no trace of the aircraft's big parts (like the engine) at the Pentagon or at the United 93 site (and I think even at the WTC). This is most suspicious.

* I am now convinced that the size of the hole on the side of the Pentagon wasn't caused by a huge jet hitting it (the windows survived, for example).

The video shows many many more loose ends and I am extraordinarily troubled by this. 

On the flip side, this is too coordinated an operation and it requires too many people for a cover-up so I have trouble believing it as such. But I would very much like answers to these questions and I get mad that there are no systematic answers forthcoming from the various powers that be. 

For those of you who dismiss this as left-wing, anti-semitic (huh?) crap, I don't see any real answers forthcoming from you either, only abuses. Address the questions that are technical, because they should be somewhat less controversial. I'd love to see references and informed discussion and links from experts who don't agree with this video's analysis, so we can setle this matter. I have been reading up for the last 7 hours and find that the the video raises "reasonable doubt".

My best friend died in these attacks.

How is the situation any different with Python?
on Abu Ghraib: 

"I, personally, am still unable to get too worked-up over what basically amounted to a harsh fraternity hazing for terrorists."

Blech. He also thinks Iraq "was an idealistic Wilsonian attempt to re-make the entire world as safe for liberal democracy, while destroying Islamic terrorism in the process."

Even the Bush administration can't really have been so deluded as to think Iraq was some kind of harbour for Islamic terrorists. This guy has some funny ideas.
I like Python too but this article is so bad I can barely finish it.  First, in the first paragraph, he conflates XML with programming languages.  Shortly thereafter, he works in how he is a wunderkind that learned programming at age 9.  Later he refers to the "complexity" of Perl without any specifics; perhaps he's referring to "map", which would be ironic.

In a nutshell: vague tripe.
I would consider XSLT as programming in XML
Please don't call it "The War on Drugs" the correct term is "The War on Some Drugs".
Yes, Ruby has advantages like blocks.

It boils down to taste, i think.  You can write code, where it is not clear, wether you use an attribute or a method or whatever (rails: has_many somethings). Ruby folks say don't care, but i do care.

Pythons philosophy is "explicit is better than implicit". This makes for example turbogears a little bit more verbose than rails. But it makes it easier to understand, what is going on.
Just a bunch of semitic right-wing baloney. I want my 3 seconds I wasted reading your uninformed (only 20 minutes of something that lasts an hour and a half !) crap statement back.

You know that it all went wrong in Iraq when William F. Buckley says its time to bring the troops home. Of course according to him it's not the fault of the American's but just the fact that Iraqui's can't deal with democracy. The old white man's burden rises it's head again.

Hobbykip? Sorry, ik kom niet zo vaak meer in nl, heeft dit iets te maken met een zeker Wolkers verhaal? :P
Overrated. 

a) Everything is depressing if you listen to music in a minor key.

b) A condemnation of the soullessness of assembly line work? Wow, this is totally timely, because the future belongs to the assembly line and not service knowledge work. &lt;/Sarcasm&gt;. While I'm sure that the poor, lonely geniuses of Detroit circa 1920 can sympathize with the film, it doesn't have much resonance in the 21st century.

c) The fire in his belly, that's like sooo deep. By which I mean, the sort of symbolism you'd expect in an 11th grade English class. Urgh. Good symbolism isn't just tacked on top of a work, it should have an organic existence within the work as well. The only point of the fire in his belly was to represent the fire in his belly. It had no relationship to the rest of the story. That's poor symbolism.

d) "Moving into management means you've sold your soul!" Again, this theme has been played out.

It's not that bad, but this is definitely overrated. It has an anti-capitalist message that I don't think holds weight in the real world. Imagine the same movie with peppy music. A guy goes to his job, but he's got big dreams. He works hard and creates a device that improves his life and the lives of others. Success and happiness follow. In the last frame, he smiles, "Wow, I feel like I'm back on the playground. Only now, it's not just me, it's everyone who bought Bliss!" Kittens and sunshine all around.

I'm not saying capitalism really works like my story either. I do think though that simplify things to this degree makes the story unable to convey much in the way of the real nuance of life.
What're you talking about?  If you're hanging precariously on a rope like that, you could break your back by falling 6 feet.  It's all about how you land.
I'm a lisp sympathiser, but I alwyas wish these articles woudl point to a concrete example of a program or a solution to a *real* problem that and say "That could only be done in lisp", or "that is 10x smaller than the equivalent perl program". Any suggestions?

Satellite photo not shown with article. However, interesting side-by-side picture of fake and real $100 bill.
Managing pointers for you combined with garbage collection is usually faster than doing it by hand these days (for example, instead of explicitly deconstructing things, in managed languages whole batches of memory are deconstructed 'at once', which is a lot faster though it costs a little more memory in the long run. This trick works because most objects aren't around for more than a couple of cycles). Sun keeps inventing fun stuff like this, though it takes a (long) while before it shows up in the JVM. Other managed languages take to such things as well, so in general, only finely tuned C or library goodness (ie: It's STILL not possible to work with YUV-coded signals in java, which makes any video work in java much slower, as you have to artificially translate YUV to RGB and back just to process the image) make C faster than managed languages. Java examples used because I'm most familiar with its guts, but it really applies to all managed languages (if it aint C it's probably managed).

First of all, bears don't have opposing thumbs, do they? Yet on the 3rd picture he's clenching that rope without any difficulty (looks like monkey's arm there).
Second, he seems to be in a leaf forest, and the bear seems to be totally outside his natural habitat (let's just say his camooflage doesn't match the surroundings)
Third, in the first pic you see some traces of photoshopping (the shading around his legs). How the hell did he climb up that thin tree-trunk anyway?
&gt; Later he refers to the "complexity" of Perl without any specifics

In that paragraph he [links to](http://reddit.com/info?id=28y2) an article he wrote about why Perl is difficult.
The article is utterly idiotic and banal imo but I suspect many people would take comfort from this kind of conscience salving. Whether or not you believe the election was rigged, a lot of Americans did vote for Bush the second time around. I think they have been duped by their media, because whatever your politics, he proved that he was simply not up to the job the first time round (and I don't believe for one minute that Americans are more stupid or evil than anyone else). I'm sure that people who voted for Bush thought they were doing a good thing for America and the world. The fact that they supported the house of horrors that is Abu-Ghraib, torture at Guantanamo, Soviet-style arrests of dissidents, widespread phone-tapping, bombing of civilians etc just does not compute for them. I think the author shows this clearly when he talks about Abu-Ghraib - of course he can't 'get worked up about it' because as someone who voted for Bush, _he has been made complicit_. Far easier to say it was just that the good guys tried to spread democracy but it didn't work out, than to admit you did a stupid thing and that Bush is not the man that the TV says he is.

The other article is no better.  Perl is difficult because it provides a) convenient iteration over standard input and b) robust regular expressions?!
&gt; in the first paragraph, he conflates XML with programming languages

Nonsense. Read it again. He uses Python, and he uses XML. He promotes Python, but he does not promote XML. The implication is that it's not his habit to promote a language just because he uses it, but rather because there is something special about it. He goes on to explain why he thinks Python is special.

He no doubt mentioned XML because he is famous for promoting REST in preference to RPC. I think he was the one who started that debate. REST typcially uses XML. I'm also familiar with his advocacy of SVG, which is an XML language. One might have supposed that he was a big fan of XML itself.

He's a smart guy, and in my opinion he is very clear-sighted when it comes to the big picture of things.

I think they are exellent. He could have simplified some of the images even more - like in the otto engine the cam/lifter mechanism could've been left out without screwing up the principle. But that would been almost oversimplifying it in my oppinion.

Actually, this got me to thinking. Especially given the hydraulic doors, and the depth, and so on,... could this have been somebodies nuke shelter from a few years back that got converted? Lots of people built basement shelters in the 50's-80's and that would explain the huge doors etc.

You don't access "attributes" of an object directly from the outside. It's always a method.

Hah, nice try. 

But there is no Mojo in LISP. Who'd believe it?

And everyone knows that LISP is too old to be good. Newer stuff has to be better. Like Windows is far superior to Unix. And like VB2005 is a better language than LISP.

This does raise an interesting question though. Why hasn't LISP, I mean ZVKOMOJO, slipped into obscurity like other old computer things like, um, COBOL, and the client-server-model, and big IT departments, and mainframes (on or not on a chip)?

I agree. The problem is with people who think the bible has authority, not with specific cases of this phenomenon.

While compressing a program into as few a lines of code as possible is an interesting task in itself, no-one is claiming that it constitutes readable code.

Why the hell is he using code which is designed to be read by a computer, rather than a human, as evidence that perl is an ugly language.

He fails Logic 101.

I guess if you look at it in a really, really shallow way, that's what you would see. In my mind, the movie was about the dream of finding the Great Idea and not having to worry anymore, something I thought a lot of Redditors would identify with. It's a rather capitalistic idea, isn't it? Of course, in the end, it pokes you with the fact that all the success and happiness in the world will not bring back the carefree joy of your childhood - a sad truth. (I think it's also saying that once you've already achieved success, you won't have that fire in your belly anymore. Compare Einstein working alone in the patent office to Einstein in his later years.)

I'm not sure why this film didn't touch you. Haven't you ever had the feeling that you've got *the Idea*, and it's going to make you rich if you can ever find the time to work on it? You know, that feeling that makes all the horrors of life worthwhile? If you haven't, then perhaps your existence truly is as grey as that movie was.

C++ has rather a large number of features, and they can interact in irregular ways. Also, there are various awkward little details that can trip you up. The program/file unit structure is a bit old and odd. If something fails it will just die and give you nothing: no stacktrace or messages.

Having said that, nearly everything can be mitigated with practiced idiomatic usage. And considering its combination of good points: popularity, OO, speed, it doesn't have much/any real competition.

I'm not sure why you'd be teary about this. I'm sure shooting 6 3-pointers is very difficult, but autism is not a physical disability; there's nothing especially impressive about this guy having done it.

&gt; natural blonds are likely to be extinct within 200 years because there are too few people carrying the blond gene.

A little number of people carrying the gene is not a reason strong enough to make the gene disappear. It can make the gene easier to be extinguished in case of consecutive accidents, but it doesn't represent a reason by itself.

What matters on the long run is: does the gene give its bearer an advantage or a disadvantage over other individuals?
And actually having blond hair seems to give a little advantage on finding a mate (in particular because it's an indicator for high oestrogen levels in women).

The idea is: Store all the nodes in a single table. Each node row is given a special node-address field. This is derived from the original tree, and is used to reconstitute it, by external logic.

This doesn't exploit/reuse any of the database's structuring and query capabilities though.

Ruby also has its own disadvantages. Pythonists advocate the idea of "there is only one way". Rubyists advocate "Tim Toady" (there is more than one way to do it).

Its easier to take a collection of Python scripts and understand all of them, than it is to take a collection or Ruby scripts and understand all of them (assuming each is written by different programmers).

Ruby is also slightly slower and not quite as mature. There are both advantages and disadvantes when comparing Python and Ruby. They are very similar in many ways, anyway, so in my opinion, you should use which one fits you best.
Ruby all the way up, dudes.
Great article, too bad he doesn't have any tips for lefties :-(  I don't think the hand positions and pen inclinations would work for a lefty.
The Francis Fukuyama piece the first link (under the above link) is referring to is in the Guardian, here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1715179,00.html . It is, altogether, a much better article.
&gt; Also, if you have any exceptions in your C++, you blow your performance, due to the requirement that exiting the scope via the exception call the destructors.

I was under the impression that this was a common misconception.

As I understand it, the runtime performance penalty for an unthrown exception is comparable to a conditional checking the return value of a function; it's often-times even less than that.  Exceptions in most mainstream C++ compilers are now implemented as "jump pads" that destruct the stack when they get jumped to; a jump to the pad is the code that the "throw" statement actually emits.

The runtime penalty for a thrown exception is obviously high.  This is one of the reasons using exceptions for non-exceptional cases is such a bad idea.  Exceptions should rarely be thrown in a correctly functioning program.

Implemented as jump pads, exceptions can also significantly increase the size of the binary, since you end up with very similar code for destructing the same stack in a number of places.  A possible cache performance caveat, I suppose; keep in mind that the code should never be using cache space, since it should never be executing.

Am I under the wrong impression?

I personally use Ruby on Rails at my day job. I am also in the process of learning Python. From the surface they seem like very similar languages to me, but it is also very apparent that they have some radically different design implementations.

Basically, I would just like to get some input from people who have used or have experience with both languages that can discuss differences/similarities, and advantages/disadvantages of each one.

That's a fuzzy question... Ruby+Rails is not quite the same as Python by itself. Rails accomplishes a lot of donkey-work through code generation... this at first seems like a great idea. Except that the generation is one-way. If you fsck up you have to start over and possibly clobber what changes you've made to the generated code.

Ruby has slightly more facile support for higher-order procedures. If you want to generate a bunch of procedures/classes from a pattern in Python you have to tinker with internal '__foo__' structures.



Python does pretty well, however. Their approach is to take useful techniques and add explicit support in the language. For example: if you've ever read the Abelson-Sussman book or seen the lectures, Python generators are the 'streams' they talk about in section 6. List comprehensions are a very nifty replacement for most of the common looping &amp; accumulator macros one might write in Lisp.
&gt;According to the study, north European women evolved blonde hair and blue eyes at the end of the Ice Age to make them stand out from their rivals at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.

Phenomenally inane misrepresentation of the study. The point could be made simply: Blond hair may have become widespread due to sexual selection after a population crunch. Dunno if it's true, but it doesn't offend common sense.
When you talk about code generation in RoR, I assume your basing it on the video. My experience in using rails is that only the most trivial, time-saving code generation is used (basically just empty classes, plus useful folders), and that you don't run into situations where this causes any problems.

But maybe I'm using it wrong :)
I thought Reddit was supposed to be what's new online...not what's months old online.
Ok. You're right. They should be applauded for this.

But keep in mind that they're all fuckers.
It's a little different in Ruby. I know I'd normally never use blocks and lambdas much in other languages because the core API doesn't support them; i.e., I'd have to write classes and methods that take blocks to start using blocks. But Ruby's core API is filled with methods that take blocks. So I'd say that the Ruby programmer uses blocks, if not more, more than other programmers.

Not Python-experienced, but I think Python-ers use list comprehensions frequently (where Ruby uses Array.each {block}, Python uses listcomps, and so on).
"What would end up happening to Java?"

Everyone would have to use Jython.
I think how often you use those kind of features is a function of how neatly they're incorporated into the language. In ruby I don't use blocks stored in variables (procs) that often, but I use anonymous blocks passed to methods all the time. And when programming in lisp I use lambdas *all* the time.
If you're interested, the article about this is on reddit: http://reddit.com/goto?id=15ro
That's probably it. Thanks for clarifying. The scaffolding is what provoked my old crusty engineer reaction... the most expensive mistakes are design bugs. Calcifiying your classes &amp; such right at the start usually isn't a good idea.

If you mean that in Ruby I can define a generic pattern for a function which generates an HTML tag, and use that to make specific functions for each tag using some config file, then use those to build bigger abstract chunks, then I say right on.

Yeah, I don't think the idea is to always demonstrate practical solutions to problems.  It's sort of a "hey look, you can do this cool thing with CSS" site.

I don't really agree that a table is a good choice for a calendar. To my mind tables should be about presenting data based on two variables... the number of hits a website got for each day of the week per browser type, or sales per staff member per month.  Think about it... what would you label the columns and rows if you used tables to make a calendar?

Just because they're the same shape doesn't mean it makes sense to use the same markup.  Of course, CSS is probably the wrong tool too but it doesn't hurt to experiment ;)

One's karma is supposed to represent how 'good' one is, how beneficial one is to the reddit community. One's karma is depends on the links one submits (hopefully also on [the amount of time one spends in the new queue](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=27uy) ). However the score of links is very much a populist score. People can get high karma if they please the masses.

I propose that when I look at a person's karma, I don't see a one-size-fits-all score, instead I should see a karma that depends on how much that person's interests are like my own. In essence each user would have N karmas (where there are N reddit users). Thus when I see a link, that link's score would depend on who had liked/disliked that link and what their karma is *relative to me*. This way links that I would like will *appear* to me to have a high score.

This would also allow me to see what users are like my own, my looking for high karma people.
I wish I could recoup those 8 hours a day as much as anyone, but frankly this sounds a little unhealthy, or, at best unpleasant.

This would also have the added benefit of spammers not really seeing how badly their submissions do unless they log out.
More than likely it was because they were making millions of dollars.  When you are talking about that much weight, it has to pass through countless hands on its way down the line.  They don't supeona electricity bills until after you are already under investigation.
They just discussed this at the last Google-Sun analyst briefing, and Eric Schmidt quite emphathetically turned the possibility down.
Is it really any more silly than believing that the universe, up to and including man, was created in seven days by a god that upon being discovered by Abraham, ordered him to kill his only son, then proceeded to kill all of the people and animals of the earth except for everyone aboard a single ark in a flood caused by 40 days and 40 nights of rain and then impegrenated a virgin named Mary to bring himself to earth to give his true message several thousand years later and then delivered his revised real truth to a Mohammed on a flying horse a thousand years after that?  Isn't all this mysticism silly.  Couldn't South Park make every one of the world's religions seem ridiculous by illustrating what their scriptures actually say happened?
This article has a lot of flaws in it. For example, there are people that obey every law in Leviticus; they're called Orthodox Jews.

Though religion is riddled with inconsistencies, errors and outright lies, it is always easier for true believers to point out the additional inconsistencies of apologists and rationalizers who seek to water a faith down.

The answer? Drop religion altogether; its followers will always hate you. Study Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, and stop apologizing or feeling guilty for something you shouldn't.

Quite possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Sun holds very little value to Google because Sun holds very little value to ANYBODY.

I sometimes write drivers for ICs so there have been a few times where it is necessary to bang the bits, as well as maintenance of very old code bases.  But mostly I find myself a little more comfortable than others debugging in the "source and disassembly" window.

As far as knowing an architecture, it can be important, but usually the only time I've found it imperative is when writing to a device, sometimes you have to defeat out-of-order execution to make sure things get sent in the correct sequence.  Other than that, C does the trick.

Some excellent advice for startup founders on why you can't (and maybe shouldn't) try to keep your startup idea secret.  Well written and well argued.

There is absolutely a point. Assembly languages are all very similar, and knowing them is a great benefit to programmers. It's hard to really appreciate the architecture of a machine, or what your compiler is doing, without at least being able to *understand* assembler.
&gt; code which is designed to be read by a computer

I thought everything above machine code was designed to be read by a human at the sake of a computer.
It was once speculated that MSFT was going to base Windows Blackcomb (next vers. after Vista) on Solaris, just as Apple did with Freebie.
Why does this guy say his DVD image is 852x480 ???

The native resolution of a typical PAL DVD (MPEG2 MP@ML stream) is 720x576. If the aspect ratio is 1.78:1, you'll want to interpolate that horizontally to 1024x576.

Looks like the website compares:

- a PAL DVD image downsampled from 1024x576 to 852x480 by some unidentified process (possibly a cheap realtime software scaler), or a NTSC DVD.

- a HD image downsampled from 1920x1080 to 852x480 (by photoshop's bicubic resampler) ?

And the hi-res snapshots are probably:

- a PAL DVD image dowsampled from 1024x576 to 852x480 and then interpolated to 1920x1080, or a NTSC DVD image interpolated from 852x480 to 1920x1080.

- a native 1920x1080 HD image.

So the conclusions are completely bogus, unless the goal was to hype the author's new expensive HD toys, or to push everyone toward HD and its evil DRM. I can't see a significant difference between my PAL DVD edition of LotR and the HD images on the site.

Ugh, one day it's "Amazing picture done in MS Paint!", the next day it's "Incredible Photoshop Painting"...I just have to say, where are the GIMP masterpieces?? &lt;/RMS&gt;
A table makes a lot of sense, but an ordered list can make a [pretty classy calendar](http://tron09.com/calendar/), too.
I'm a C programmer but over the years I've written Assembler routines for x86 architecture, Zilog Z80/Z180 processors, and for interfaces into custom built hardware.  Some of the most interesting projects I've worked on required some assembler.

Most embedded system developers will still use it but for PC application programming assembler is dead.  Heck, I'm a C programmer and some people might say it's also obsolete.

Knowing the underlying hardware architecture or specific processor instructions probably won't help you write better applications.  Though I believe it still very important to understand memory management no matter what language you program in (know the difference between heap and stack space?).
No.
Well, thanks for imply that the film didn't "touch" me because I have no soul, but I prefer to think the reason is that I found it heavy-handed, depressing, and inaccurate. I'm not saying it's an awful film, but I am saying that it's not that good either.

I'm actually trying to learn assembler but there aren't that many great tutorials for NASM...But yeah, I think it would be worth learning, and remember, The Art of Computer Programming's algorithms are written in ASM (correct me if I'm wrong, please).
Definitely, yeah.

I'm also really skeptical of a non-backcompatible format. I think they'll have much better luck introducing it if they sell "Enhanced" discs that will be a DVD in a DVD player and a Bluray in a Bluray player.

That said, it sure is a gorgeous HD transfer. Wow.
Sure.   Just last week I wrote a few lines of ARM assembly language in an otherwise C++ program to run on a cell phone.  I also had to disassemble and reverse-engineer some of the runtime library in order to know what assembly language to write.

I'd never done ARM before, but no biggie -- it looks like just a cross between 6502 and PowerPC, both of which I've done lots of before :-)

Well Only Ruby people have responded.  I only know python, and I am a web programer.  I like python because of it's structure.  One can usually not help but make readable code.  This is not something I usually experience with other languages.  Where I can just dive into the library code a quickly understand what is going on.  There is very little reward for super cleverness when it comes to python.  I think this is a big deal it makes it easier to learn by reading.

next question please.

Ah, is Google trying to conquer the world?
[removed]
OpenOffice runs acceptably on a system with enough memory.

My argument is that although using languages like Python which trade execution speed for programming speed may often be the right choice, I think it would break down when applied across an entire system. 

In other words, it's OK for OpenOffice to be big and bloated because most of the other programs on my system are small and lean. If my window manager, mail client, web browser, instant messaging client, media player, and terminal emulator were all written in languages which made the same tradeoffs as Java and Python, I'd need a lot more hardware to do the job.

Horses for courses, and all that.

a *lot*. i use list comprehensions in Python all the time, and would likely use generator expressions just as much, if only i could rely on python v2.4 being available everywhere i want my code to run.

i don't use lambdas much, but mostly just because python's lambdas are such a very weak spot in the language. (one of a very few such; i really like python.) i used them more before list comprehensions, though. lambdas combined with map/reduce/filter are amazingly powerful, it's just that listcomps do the same things just as powerfully and much more readably.

blocks still seem weird to me, but that may be because i don't actually use ruby for anything. if i did, i'm fairly sure i'd love them.

i haven't used ruby, but yeah, listcomps are frequently used for iterating through a list/array and doing something with each item (that matches some criterion). another common pattern are iterators; no end of python classes are written to support the iterator interface so they can be used directly in a for loop, for instance. (a much, MUCH nicer pattern than the totally botched version Java got. but that almost goes without saying...)

i could argue that perl isn't difficult at all, and that's the whole problem with the damned thing. i doubt i could do it without duplicating [better people's criticisms](http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/blog-ancient-perl.html) of it, though.
Hey!  

Knock it off. 

That shiite's not funny.
This is somewhat interesting, but what excites me is the prospect of being rid of all blondes within a century.  Woot.

Actually, some people's hair color changes as they grow.  I was a blonde in youth but now have dark brown hair.
I suggest to use something other than IE as the URL as you probably don't want people to think you linked to the Internet Explorer subreddit.
It is difficult to distinguish US foreign politics and world politics.
I agree. Something like that would be interesting but would probably mostly voted down on main reddit due to the length (even "short" stories are longer than the average news item).
I think Its a good idea. People post links to the Photos or better yet the photos are displayed (as Thumbnails) and people vote on them.&lt;&gt;
Although his few lines of perl code might not be good evidence, he does make some good points. Anytime I have to write/modify Perl, there are many things that drive me nuts.
No, that's not what I meant at all. You couldn't have gotten it more wrong. Just forget it; i'm embarrassed for both of us.

awesome.
That's a real problem. I'm a Python guy, and I see people coming onto the Python mailing list all the time, complaining about their experience with Python, because they're trying to write [Java|C|VB] code with Python syntax. 

A lot of people seem to think that the programming style of the first language they learn is the only *right* way to do things.
知らんかった。
Open Office is mostly written in C++.  See http://contributing.openoffice.org/programming.html.
Other good ones are: bricks thrown through the window of a cheating "baby's daddy", a guy caught walking out on a $4.65 restaurant bill, and a "hangman's noose" found hanging in the doorway of a friends home.  Local news is great.
If she is the *last* blonde, then her mate will inevitably be brown-haired, making it unlikely that her kids would be blond anyway.  It's possible that he could carry a recessive blond gene, in which case there's a 50/50 chance the offspring would be blond(e).  But that is also possible for brown-haired people: if two brunettes carrying recessive blond genes mate, there's a 1/4 chance that their offspring will be blond.  So it wouldn't do much good to kill her.  Even after blondes technically go extinct, there will likely be odd exceptions popping up, possibly in-perpetuity, since the gene won't actually be extinguished from the population.

There is actually a reddit clone for images at http://our.imgseek.net/

You can tag images you see on the web and retrieve them later. And by rating images, the system learns and will then be able to recommend images you may like. It's also possible to browse images by shape and color similarity.

They are using the image similarity engine from an open source desktop app ( http://www.imgseek.net/ ) also called imgSeek.

Here's an example of similar image search: http://our.imgseek.net/image/show/5250
True, my hair bleached very easily in the sun when I was younger. How is this accounted for in this theory?

Posting thumbnails could pose a serious legal issue for reddit, given the recent case against Google's image search.  I believe it was deemed that Google's use of thumbnails did not constitute "fair use".
What about a design/art subreddit? That would encompass alot and would be less liable for copyright infringement.

The linked site never said it was PAL, as far as I could tell.

If we assume the author is using a US NTSC DVD, it would be 720x480 natively.  The pixels aren't square, however, so it needs to be upsampled to 852x480 to have the correct aspect ratio.  Thus the 852x480 resolution would be appropriate if this is from an NTSC DVD.  I think this was a valid comparison.
Definitely not with a fountain pen.
Linking to photographs does not make one liable for copyright infringement.
Actually, I'm not interested in rating images so much as I'm intrested in posts about photography as a craft. (I never liked looking at photographs on screen- there's something about going to a physical space to see real prints that's a part of the experience of photography- plus the gamma on my monitor is way off)

If reddit is a listing of "things that are intersting"  photography.reddit.com should be a listing of things that are interesting about photography. I dont quite get why topical subreddits are a bad idea. (see reddit blog) Should this be photographers reddit instead?

Using all the runway and needing to use all the runway are two quite different things.  It can be both safer and more efficient to stay on the ground or just off it (in ground effect) and use your power to accelerate to a good low-drag climb speed well above stall speed than to force the plane off the ground at low speed halfway down the runway and climb in high-drag configuration at little over stall speed.

This is especally true if there are obstacles to clear or a possibility of turbulence.

It is also more true of pure jet (not fan jet) or rocket-powered aircraft, in which the effective power of the engines is nearly directly proportional to their airspeed.

The stuff about "having to split the stock to attract investors" etc reveals that the chap don't know what he's talkin' 'bout.

Uh, you might want to study history a bit more. I'm no Puritan, but they were certainly persecuted quite heavily throughout Europe, and in cases that wasn't happening, they were certainly discriminated against by state-run churches such as the Church of England.

Do some searching on Mary Tudor (Mary I of England) and the people she killed.

But its really not suprising that once the Puritans did reach America, and became a political entity themselves with great power, that they began misusing it. It seems like mixing religion and politics has always been a bad mix.

That said, the creators said in their blog that sub-reddits "are for people." -- are there really that many groups that hierarchy is a big deal?
You know, I totally agree.

There is no 'quote' as far as i know.

You can do some meta programming, though. For example i recently learn (with help from comp.lang.lisp ;) how to creates new classes on run time. They are instances of 'type'.
Just to get the obvious joke out of the way: I thought America already had a president who was a Moron?
No worries, Personally I'm a huge fan of the streaming clip explosion on the internet as of late.. thinking back to even a year ago there was less availible out there. Nothing satisfies me more then an easily accessible clip. no download, unzipping, waiting etc...
The reason the downsampled HD version looks better than the standard DVD one is probably that most DVDs are prefiltered to reduce compression artifacts. 

The idea is simple, if you blur each frame a bit, you lower the entropy and can fit scenes into the bitrate available without getting annoying compression artifacts.

When it comes to FOTR, the PAL verison is less filtered than the NTSC release so it looks better. Strangely it doesn't have more vertical resolution. I think this is fixed in The Two Toweers though.

Heres a comparison with more analysis: http://www.videophile.info/Review/FOTR/FOTR_01.htm
&gt; 5. Hosting is still scary. Exhibit A: Salesforce.

The blog article makes some good points and this has got to be the most important one.  I think that companies are reluctant to switch to hosted applications because they're reluctant to switch any application.  Now add the fact that the hosting companies are young and unproven.  And there are few of them.

I think that hosting will not really take off until it is simple and painless to switch hosting companies.  I think this will require a standardized platform for hosted applications.  Then we will see a divergence of the "application host" into an application provider and a hosting provider.  Then it will be simple to switch hosting providers and move your application and data to a new host.  This would be like building a new set of servers and moving your Exchange installation to it.  Switching application providers will require converting your data into the format of the new application.  This would be like switching from Exchange to Lotus Notes.

Hopefully the move to hosted apps will result in an improvement of the administrative tools of our applications.  The savings in server maintenance will be significant.  Hosting providers will be able to provide more reliability for a lower cost through economies of scale.  The standardized application platform is the key technology to be created.

The article links to two ZDNet blogs that are pure exec-speak.  They refer to "Web 2.0" like it is some holy grail, hyping it like they did XML so many years ago.  The word "mashup" has got to be the most disgusting new term to come out of these people in a long time.  PC Magazine and its friends kept their mouth shut about proprietary applications for years, pandering to their advertisers.  The IT media is full of hypocrites because they hail "mashups" but refuse to speak up for the adoption of openness for fear of offending their advertisers.  Amazon is brilliant for offerring an API into their product database.  We need other online companies to provide similar APIs: Skype, MSN Messenger, AOL IM, NewEgg, etc.  The ZDNet people use their marketing jargon, like "innovation from the bottom up", so they don't have to say "trust other coders".  What it really comes down to is trust and security.  Only a company that does something well and feels confident in its technical position will be able to open up its data and cooperate with their potential competitors.  I think that execs in most companies have an innate distrust of coders (hackers), especially ones that don't work for them.  They're so focused on making money that they miss opportunites to let their company's product become an important part of somebody else's product.

I stopped reading IT trade magazines around 1999 because they never cited the instability of the applications they reviewed.  A piece of software would get a 5 star recommendation but crash when I try to use it.

Firefox is a new free web browser that is quickly gaining massive popularity and a lot of media attention. It is all-around safer, faster, easier, and more useful than Internet Explorer. Since its premier in November 2004, it has been downloaded over 140 million times and is now used by over 10% of the public. Firefox has been developed by a group of highly dedicated and skilled open source programmers who work without pay. Their motivation isn't money, but simply to make the best web browser available, so that they and their friends and family can have a better web browsing experience.

As someone who´s interested in photography but not enough to regularly check a seperate page about it, I´m worried that this development will lead to less photography-related links on the main page.

More generally, it seems that subreddits will suck content of their sort from the main page.

(I understand that the recommended page may solve this in an ideal world, but to me, for now, and no offense intended =), it´s not functional.)

I´m sure the folks running this site are considering possible solutions (ie including highly-rated subreddit items on the main page, maybe allowing control of this to the users´ preference), and I´m curious to hear them, especially before I give my feedback on subreddits.

This is much better criticism of Perl.  However I take exception to the following: "But if I ever start my own company, Perl won't be allowed there".  That's too bad, because you might well be missing out on a lot of code from CPAN that already does what you need it to.

Agreed, the author is probably sincere.

My point is: Users shouldn't blame the low visual quality of NTSC DVDs on the DVD standard itself. If they tried PAL DVDs, preferably on a non-interlaced display, maybe they wouldn't feel compelled to rush to the wonderful world of HD DRM.

the minimum threshold for sites in reddit is the same for hot/new/recommended pages. Usually, I want a min. threshold like 10 for recommended articles and zero(or even a bit -ve) is fine for new submissions.

There's an option for it.
I have mixed feelings about this article. I agree that aid given to African governments is largely wasted, but I don't agree that free trade is the solution. This is because Africa will always be at a disadvantage in this sphere. The West used protectionism over the past 100 or so years to build up its industries, and now that this is no longer an appropriate policy, it advocates (selective) free trade. 
This hypocrisy needs to be challenged, but in a free trade environment Africa will never be able to build the industrial capacity to compete with developed economies, and will remain an exporter of raw materials and talented people.
The solution is to devolve aid and assistance away from governments and down to grassroots level. Right across Africa, millions of people are involved in organisations striving to improve their rights. These include trade unions, church groups, community organisations and so on. They are generally membership-based, democratic, and almost all massively under resourced. They promote everything from fair labour standards, freedom of expression to organic farming to women's health, and need to be supported.
The West - which owes a huge debt to Africa for building up its wealth over the past 500 years of colonialism - should create a no-strings-attached fund that is rigorous in its selection process, but autonomous of any government influence. This money should go directly to the people on the ground who are making a difference.
Much more important than financial aid, though, is actually listening to these people, giving them a platform and a voice, and lobbying for their point of view in international forums.

I don't think focusing on women is the answer.  They are less predisposed to sexual abuse, but gender alone isn't going to solve abuse in general.  Counterexamples I can think of off hand are Lynndie England at Abu Gharib, British (late 1800s) and Soviet ('70-80s) tales of torture at the hands of Afghan women, and Lebanese Christian militias in the '80s considered brutal enough to "shock" visiting Israeli officers.  The answer is probably a combination of more professionalism in peacekeepers coupled with transparency of allegations and actually investigating and  prosecuting alleged crimes.
The article explains why.
Once again The Register shows that they are more interested in sensationalist clap-trap than hard facts.
It's okay to make mistakes, but by now they should know the truth and post a correction.

One problem with giving food to poor countries is that local farmers can't compete with donated food, and so they go out of business. But production and trade are precisely what these countries need in order to raise their standards of living.

Here's an alternate interpretation of the article:  If you execute poorly, you have let the cat out of the bag, and now others will be able to copy your idea and if they're clever) execute it better. Which is exectly waht happens if you simply blb about your Big Idea, since zero execution is the worst execution of all.

The argument then seems to be, not that you shouldn't try to hold ideas close to the vest (you should), but rather don't be fooled into thinking that your secret new idea will stay secret or new for very long, or that you'll have more than one shot at public unveiling.  So work fast, work smart, and get it right the first time.
Most likely, the video was being put out as part of a military propoganda campaign, and therefore not intended to be viewed by domestic audiences.  I recall hearing a soundbite of Rumsfeld grumbling that the internet was causing  too much US propoganda to makes its way back to the US.

"Some people say that Ruby is not as powerful as Lisp and Smalltalk. I dispute that notion. Ruby has C. Ruby is C. Ruby has tools that have been created with C. But Ruby is the highest interface to C that I have ever seen: closures, dynamic evalatuation of code, etc. How can these other languages beat the combination of Ruby and C? They can't!"

Shows a lack of experience with languages such as lisp and smalltalk, both beating ruby for expressiveness, and lisp at least beating it (blindfolded, one hand tied behind the back) for performance.

I like ruby but this article makes me sad.  It sounds so defensive, and it doesn't make a ton of sense to me.

Sure is pretty. I like the URLs being defined at the top instead of having to monkey around with them in another file like Rails.

Another thing I like about this is it isn't unnecessarily broken down. In Rails the code section itself would be broken down into 2 different sections due to Rails' model-view-controller (MVC) approach. This always seemed pretty unnecessary to me, as its often very debatable whether your code belongs in the controller or the model (find() actually will work in both of them).

Does anyone know if there are any disadvantages to using a two-pronged approach (code and view) instead of MVC? Granted, this is a pretty small app, but it is very intuitively done.

What templating engine is it using? That's the only part of it I really don't like.

The paragraph on performance isn't that good.

In the beginning, he only talks about startup time, not general performance.

Then, he claims that IE is faster at rendering simple and small pages - which is definitely not an interesting issue, because that's where performance does not matter.

Many of the other "myths" are not myths, but rather inaccurate claim. The answer is always "not true, only 97 % true".

There also just sources for the claims being refuted, but no sources for the counter-claims.

I completely agree with you on this. It's the bad part about polyphasic sleep. I did 2 equal sleep sessions almost without fail for a year of college, but that's because it fit my schedule well.

We run into this problem constantly.  It's not easy.  I think in a startup you need more than one founder, and your cofounder should be someone you've known for a while (ideally years, but at least 3 months).  So if none of your friends will start a company with you, you have to make more friends.  

Judging from past startups, there are three places where that happens: at school (Google), at work (Hotmail), and in user groups (Lotus).  Perhaps now there will start to be a fourth: open source projects.  

The best bet seems to be school. If I were 18 and wanted to start a startup, I'd go to the best college I could, and once there recruit the best hacker I could find.  Probably someone older, since most fellow freshmen would be leery of dropping out to start a company.
Tom and Jerry is Christian, as in "the meek shall inherit etc", far more protestant than anything by Warner Bros (Bugs Bunny was from Brooklyn, making it likely a "Jew" or a "Popist").

But why not these prisoners?  Wouldn't their day in court only show the world how despicable they are?  Wouldn't we hear from their mouth their hatred of us?  Wouldn't the light of day justify our imprisonment of these captive?  Unless of course we are worried what they will say?  What could that be, that worries us so much?  I don't know.

When I read that I took it as hyperbole. That said the big complaint he has about perl is that the development mindset the language encourages leads to code that is difficult to maintain*.

While I agree that ideally there should be more than one founder, I totally understand this guy's situation.

I got my interest in technology while growing up in a small technology-focused town in socal. I'd constantly toy around with any new tech that I could get my hands on and learn as much as possible, regardless of what my capabilities were expected to be limited to at that age.

Eventually, though, I moved to a small town on the east coast. There I went to a small private school were I had maybe one or two good science teachers but not much else. Eventually I got used to the idea that learning anything new **is 100% my job**. ..Doing well in school will be no excuse to be incompetent in your future career.

Back in socal when I'd dive deep into some technical challenge I felt as though I was part of a close group that was racing to achieve something great. In the places I've lived since then it seems as though I'm the only person that's interested at all.

At the university I go to now I can count the number of capable people on.. *two fingers*, and thats pushing it. Seriously. Just no one cares. No one sees themselves going beyond the traditional employment routes to achieve some amazing (even if over-ambitious) goals.

My *highly valuable ;)* advice to you is to **just go for it.**  Be flexible in what your company provides; And since you probably won't hit it big until your at least in college, don't make the mistake that many of us have. Take at least a little bit of time to chose a school that will have many smart people around while not overloading you with work.

The reason why the number of blondes will decrease is that the gene for blondeness is recessive.  It assumes that blondes will intermarry with non-blondes.

As an example:
Suppose 10 percent of the people in the world were blonde with 2 blonde genes, and 90% non-blonde, with no blonde genes.  10% of the genes are blonde.  If people marry at random, there will be 1% blondes, 18% non-blondes with 1 blonde gene, and 81% of people with no blonde gene.  If each set of parents had 2 kids, the number of blondes would have dropped 10-fold.

There's no reason for blondes to disappear entirely though.    As long as 1 out of 75,000 genes is for blondeness, one would expect an average of at least 1 blonde in a population of 6 billion.
Very funny, but probably counterproductive.

Unfortunately, my country (US) seems to have the [world's largest](http://www.csdp.org/research/r234.pdf) incarceration rate and prison population. (An exception may be China, because they have many undocumented prisoners; I hear that if you guess by doubling their official numbers, they may be on par or exceed us.)

So if we apply the standards to ourselves that we'd apply to any other nation, and observe that we disproportionately imprison certain racial minorities (as race correlates with wealth), there are reasonable conclusions we can draw.

&gt;the language encourages leads to code that is difficult to

&gt;*Obviously there are only two cases where this is valid, 
&gt;bad programmers (through lack of time or just plain 
&gt;ineptitude) or hard problems.

i hope you were being sarcastic. because that's not only not right, it isn't even wrong.

language *syntax* alone can lead to hard-to-maintain code, by necessity, through forcing you to write code that is difficult to read. dig into any of the old non-freeform languages that used to be popular in the days of punch-card input for examples.

language *semantics* can lead to even more insidious difficulties. Steve Yegges complains about perl's references in that rant of his, and having fought with them myself, i can only agree with him. references, like pointers, are inane; they force you to think about how the computer physically manages your data structures when you could just be thinking about how to structure your data instead.

even language *customs* can lead to hard-to-maintain code. i've never written, or even read, any C++ code, but nonetheless i've had to quietly suffer no end of rants about how horrible the STL is to work with, and how you definitely shouldn't even think about using something else in its stead, and yada yada. that's not even the fault of C++ proper, and it still impacts maintainability of C++ code.

language design has a tremendous impact on code maintainability, quite apart from programmer ability or problem difficulty. if it didn't, we might as well all just write machine code (or unlambda, or brainfuck) - HLLs were invented for a reason.
Reddit is actually a great example of the sort of site that he's talking about. Reddit seems to be trying the Google model of coming in as ultra lightweight and full of nothing but functionality, hoping to build enough of a userbase that they can flip it to a buyer on the premise that they can turn those users into profit.

It won't happen.

Once you set the bar for a site like this as "zero ads/zero cost", your userbase comes to expect and demand it. If reddit tries to switch, invariably 100 reddit ripoffs would appear, and the community would swarm away. It's a sad situation.

Hey, it's like "Camping":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/ just more complicated.
For a gene, being recessive does not imply being weaker.

If there is no difference looking at the fitness of blondes and non-blondes, the distribution of genotypes will remain more or less constant. 
As a consequence, the same holds for the distribution of the phenotypes - the number of blondes.

PS: There is also no single gene for blondeness, I guess, so everything here is a simplification.
Minimal? You obviously don't have an HDTV set.

I'm not really sure what the point of the linked page is, as it's vastly downsizing HDTV -- how in the world does that demonstrate the quality? If you want a good comparison, look at a 720p (1280x720) or 1080i (1920x1080) image, and upsample the DVD frame to that. It'll be much, much more evident.

There is a HUGE quality difference between HDTV and DVD. After watching even network television shows in HDTV, CSI and Without a Trace being good ones, going back to standard definition is like putting some blurry glasses on. It really is remarkable.
_I deal with companies every day who have no qualms about charging 25 cents to send 160 characters of data from one person to another, or who have no problems charging $3.00 for a 10kb .gif image or a bad .midi version of a popular song, or even up to $10.00 for a small Java clone of Tetris - a 20 year old game._

Yeah, and that industry sucks! If that's what you want to happen to the web, you're a jerk. Luckily it won't happen since people on the web won't put up with nearly as much shit as mobile users.
"Users shouldn't blame the low visual quality of NTSC DVDs on the DVD standard itself"

PAL has only 20% more pixels, yet you're talking like they're night in day. On the flip side PAL sacrifices colour clarity (talking about the PAL wire standard), and lowers the frequency to 25Hz, so it's hardly a panacea. Sorry, I'll take an NTSC set any day of the week.

FURTHERMORE, when they make DVDs they have a fixed volume of space to fill, so they set the compression ratio accordingly (leading to some fast action scenes looking like sheeit, or evidence of posterization). PAL having 20% more pixels doesn't magically mean there's 20% more capacity on the disc -- it simply means that they have to turn compression up even more to fit it on the disc. Just like the NTSC vs PAL wire standard, the resolution of PAL on a fixed bandwidth medium isn't the win-win you seem to think it is.
Which only proves that you are as ignorant as Rep. Ron Hood. ;)

Russell doesn't remember the Nineties very well.  Greenspan "finally looked around and said, essentially, “WTF is going on here?”" in 1997.  In other words, before overvaluation of tech stocks began.  Afterwards, he recanted, and by the time the bubble burst, seemed to be as caught up in it as anyone.  

I guess Russell is one those people who need the comfort of a wise authority who has things under control, and so fits his memory of history to fit that wish.  But it doesn't exist.  Greenspan doesn't know what's happening.  Ben Bernanke doesn't know what's happening.  The biggest danger to our prosperity is the centralization of power in the Fed.  Monetary policy should be set with some kind of direct democracy.  Call it the WikiFed.

I wish more people would come to this realization, acegopher.

It's funny, many traditional conservative positions (e.g., small government, opposition to publicly-funded welfare) are predicated (in part) on the assumption that people are fundamentally selfish and will work to gain power, money, etc. at cost to other people.

This is different than the perspective of the republican party currently (disclaimer: I'm not saying Dems aren't guilty, just focusing on the GOP for now).  The current Republican stance seems to be that "other people" are self-interested, but that "we" (GW, his cronies, senators, governors, etc.) are not and that the GOP only has "America's best interests" at heart.
Lets look at the real merits behind these laws:

a) Gays would teach adoptee's to be open and experimental.  To protect rights of others and to cherish people who different.

b) Republicans would teach adoptee's to god-fearing and refer back often on a book inspired by an invisible diety.  To protect the rights of only those who follow the same book  and to fear those who are different.

They had a multimillion-$ buyout offer from Google already.  What I don't understand is why they didn't take it.  I don't see how a site like Reddit could grow to be worth *more* than that, when it's a.) easy to clone and b.) doesn't generate enough value to pay for.
Why not in the open court system?  Why behind the bar of a hidden tribunal?  Aren't we treading dangerously close to Soviet russia, where you must just simply trust the collective good will?

What's your source? I've heard that there's been a buyout offer, but heard it described as "lowball", with no amount.
That's kind of his point - if web users won't put up with as much shit as mobile users, it's not a viable business.  Price is a way of gauging a service's actual *value* to people.  Anyone will come visit a random website, because it doesn't cost them anything.  But to make people actually pay for a service requires that you deliver value in excess of what they're paying.  It's a way of keeping businesses honest and making sure they're actually delivering something useful rather than an odd nifty diversion.

Isn't it almost irrelevant where they were caught and under what circumstances? The point is humans shouldn't be treated like this.

I'm disgusted but feel powerless (note: I live outside the USA)

&gt; If there is no difference looking at the fitness of blondes and non-blondes, the distribution of genotypes will remain more or less constant

But according to the original study the enviornment has changed in several ways:

 * There is no longer a significant shortage of males.

 * Bleached blondes are now, on average and according to the study's statistics, preferable for mating over natural blondes.

&gt; For a gene, being recessive does not imply being weaker.

As far as genes go, being recessive definitely does make it weaker.

How is my math wrong? (Or just press the down arrow, that works.)

*[edit] oh you meant that it doesn't make the **person** less fit to reproduce. got it.*
We don't know what causes homosexuality, but I don't think it's reasonable yet to conclude that there's a certain gene that is related (i.e. I know at least one pair of identical twins where one is gay and the other is not).  However, it is certainly not valid to equate homosexuality with feminism/women professionals.  That would be like saying eventually there will be no more popes because the pope cannot have children.
And you would have us believe that they were convicted murderers.

It doesn't matter what they were. You're supposed to have to prove it before you lock someone away for years and years. And once you lock them up, you're supposed to treat them humanely. 

No, obviously they have figured out a way so that this is not, de facto, required. But it is still antithetical to American mores and values.

I think that Alberto Gonzales belongs in the International Criminal Court. *But I'd actually let him have a trial*, even though we all know what he's done.
Feminism isn't genetic; it's a belief, not a primal urge.

While I can see your point that a feminist mother is likely to indoctrinate her daughters with similar ideals, many children develop their beliefs as a backlash against what they see around them, rather than falling to the rhetoric presented to them.

It's common to rebel against one's parents' ideals simply for the sake of rebelling, so feminists are always likely to develop from families where the mother takes a particularly subservient role.

Its approaching infinity.  Apple is evil.
Religious people aren't considered to be second class citizens  as opposed to homosexuals whom are. Religious ideas are like all other ideas and inventions - subject to criticism.
This is true, but hardly surprising.  They're not going to come out and say "We honestly couldn't give a shit about any of you, we're just trying to put foward our political agenda and to earn ourselves a place in the history books".  Any party has to appear to care about the greater good.

On a somewhat unrelated note, I think that both Republicans and Democrats are sufficiently right-wing that they both work on the assumption that people are inherently selfish.  Only the idealists on the far left credit people with any degree of integrity, and we've all seen where that got them.

We do not tread anywhere close to Soviet Russia because there is no evidence we are regularly putting mass quantities of citizens into anything resembling what the Gulag was.  Or *any* citizens, for that matter.

Terrorists should be treated as less than properly badged enemy combatants.  They cannot possibly be allowed the same access and privilege to defense that suspect criminal citizens do.

It is important to recognize that dealing with terrorism is a military matter and not of a civilian nature.  To bring them before a court the same way a citizen could be is to give them full attorney-client privilege and full, unfettered access to the prosecution's evidence.

When dealing with military combatants who do not play by the rules, you simply cannot have a system which allows the suspects to plot, scheme, and communicate with their organization unmonitored (through the lawyer), nor can you be revealing names and identities of informants in open court.  Most of these informants and their evidence comes from intelligence organizations, whose mere revelation can sometimes compromise their cover and efforts.

Note the distinction between citizens and non-citizens.  In trying a civilian, a government can guarantee (to a reasonable extent) the safety of witnesses.  A government also has tools to deal with domestic organizations to alleviate the fear of the suspect communicating with their brothers-in-crime.  These safeguards do not exist with foreigners who have zero respect for international law and who have access to foreign military organizations.

If they are truly innocent, a fair military tribunal will see to their exoneration.

Saab is yet another division of General Motors, which sells warmed-over versions of Subarus and Chevys. To make their cars uniquely Sweedish, they put the ignition switch in the console and make sure the cars exhibit vicious torque steer thanks to surging, terror-inducing turbochargers.

Er, "expected".

Geez.
Regina Lynn, of Wired Magazine, had an article on this sort of stuff recently.

Being recessive doesn't make a gene weaker in the sense that it does nothing to lessen the likelihood of the person carrying it surviving or reproducing.  Thus being recessive  does not cause a reduction of the gene's presence in the genepool.

If a gene lessens one's chances of surviving or reproducing when it is expressed, then I would expect being recessive to make the gene stronger.
omg! that's fuckin' funny.
&gt; It is important to recognize that dealing with terrorism is a military matter and not of a civilian nature.

Are you simple? Was there a military tribunal for Timothy McVeigh? That is a completely arbitrary distinction. If you can get politicians (and everyone else, really) to stop calling things/people terrorism/terrorists for any reason whatever, then your position could begin to make sense. But that is not the case. 

Obviously terrorism can be either civilian or military.

&gt; Note the distinction between citizens and non-citizens. In trying a civilian ... A government also has tools to deal with domestic organizations ...

Huh. That sounds like the distinction between civilians and non-civilians, and foreign and domestic organizations. What does that have to do with the difference between citizens and non-citizens? Oh, right... people think it's ok to deny the bill of rights to non-citizens. That is the only distinction you are actually making.

&gt; If they are truly innocent, a fair military tribunal will see to their exoneration.

And how can we make it fair?
I love the way Reddit works, whenever a mistaken story gets voted up the correction can get voted up farther.
I'm sorry, but functional languages seem to be the easiest to implement. Of course, optimizing that implementation is a big deal, but the time to get "something that works" is pretty low. (I've implemented subsets of Scheme, JavaScript, and Erlang.)
I want one!! Hell, I want several. ;-)
If people perceive my previous email as anti-religious or anti-gay, I apologize.  It wasn't meant to be negative against either.  Upon reading it again, I can see why it looks that way.  De-modding myself.  Again my bad.  I support both.  People should be free to practice either. 

Thing I am concerned with is when someone attempts to places their specific world views on everyone else.  For instance, it is common knowledge some world religions have it written in their holy text against homosexuality (usually sending those who practice homosexuality to the deepest of their hells).  Now, the original bill to banish adoptions for the gays, seems to be heavily linked to this idea.
I guess the first step to religious persecution was the War on Christmas ? :)
It would have been a lot more effective it it had banned divorced people from adopting children.

Most arguments against gay adoption run along religious and traditional family lines.  Yet divorce is also a sin according to the Bible, and shatters many more families than homosexuality.

By listing Republicans in the bill, it can be written off as a cheap political attack.  By listing divorced people, it might have made a few people think.

Actually, that's what makes religious ideas so dangerous. You're not allowed to question- they call it dogma for a reason.  

For example: Thinking that Native Americans are desentants of a Jewish tribes is stupid- but you can't question it if you're on an LDS trip.
Completely ordinary vibrator. Whatever.

They're going to let you pick which subreddits are visible on the main page for you. And I'm sure they'd have a reasonable default.
I'm not saying there is no genetic influence.  My point was just that homosexuality could be caused by the interaction of multiple factors, in which case it is much less likely to disappear from the population.  However, just because there's a genetic influence does not mean that the gene will eventually die out due to a lack of reproduction.  As you pointed out, the prenatal hormonal theory could explain the biological origin of homosexuality.  However, according to this theory, homosexuality results from an interaction of genes with the environment, in which case there would be many people with the homosexuality susceptibility gene who were not exposed to the particular hormones in the womb to make them express those genes.  Therefore, the genes will persist.

Another issue is that without a clear and easy way to figure out what your idea/business is about, most people will filter you out regardless.  There's simply too much competition for technical talent out there for people to consume energy trying to figure out what you're trying to do.  If you were a public figure or luminary, people may dig deeper just on name recognition.  Without that, burden is on you.

It doesn't make the *genotype* weaker.  It can make the *phenotype* weaker.

Consider an isolated group of only blondes making up 10% of the world's population.  As they interbreed only with each other, all their children are blonde, for a total of 10% of the world's population.

Now consider what happens if they mingle with the rest of the world, all of whom (for the sake of argument) have 2 brown-haired genes.  If you are one of these blonde people, you have only a 10% chance of finding another blonde to mate with and having a blonde kid.  The other 90% of the world will automatically have brunettes.  Thus, only 1% of the next generation is blonde.  Then it's .01% in the next generations, 10^-8 in the one after that, and so on.  You can see why they predict extinction.

However, that does *not* mean the gene has become extinct.  Assuming equal fitness, the absolute proportion of the gene in the population should remain the same - instead of 10% of the population having 2 blonde genes, 20% would have one.  And you would get spontaneous blondes popping up when two carriers interbred.  Since 1 in 5 people carries a recessive blonde gene, you'd expect an eventual frequency of 1 in 25, or about 4%.  Actually, that would alter the numbers a bit and make the pendulum swing back.  But the equilibrium should be about a 4% blonde population, with another 12% carrying a recessive blonde gene.  Phenotypically, it's died out somewhat, but genotypically, it's identical.

I would agree that is one of the core principles of Christianity, a very noble one.  I truly respect that. Wouldn't you agree that there other writing in the bible that contradict that core belief?  Trying not to be offensive, but to get a point across.

In the bible, a story about Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities smited by the lord.  Usually cited when explaining why Homosexuality is wrong.  With this story, one can reason, those who are gay will be smited by the lord.  It seems justifies mistreatments.  If the almighty is doing it, why can't we?
Thanks for the response. (I'm the submitter of the reddit link and the Ask MetaFilter question it points to.)

I agree that having a like-minded friend makes it much easier to start a tech business. But what about for people who don't have that luxury? (I'm a high school student who will be taking a year off before college, so I'm at least a year away from living in fertile ground for startups.) I don't want to postpone implementing my idea for a year or two, since I find it more engaging and interesting than anything else I can possibly imagine.

Given those constraints--no tech friends and no college for at least a year--how would you recommend finding a partner? You have tons of experience with these situations, and I'd love to hear your advice on how to find startup partners when there are no existing friends or peers who'd be interested, available, or capable. Thanks!

So basically what you are saying is that it is no longer necessary for gay people to hide their gayness by having children with straight people, because it is socally acceptable to be gay (in some parts of the world).  Even if that is the case, and homosexuality is genetic, I don't think that it would be "bred out", for two reasons:  1) Lesbians can still have children with donated sperm.  I know many lesbian couples who have had children this way.  2) Gay men can (and do) donate sperm to sperm banks for both straight and gay women to use.  As a matter of fact, some of those lesbians that I know that had children spcfically sought out a sperm donor who was gay.

So no, I don't think homosexuality will be bred out.
Couldn't agree more. My thoughts exactly.
Subtleties? Are you kidding me? It's about as subtle as a hammer. Earthboundkid expresses this point so well elsewhere on this page that i won't bother going into the details again.

Good review. This is nothing more than the same old story that's already been rehashed countless times, from Citizen Kane to The Hudsucker Proxy.
They CAN and WILL drive 55!
This is a repost, but since it is so good, I still gave it an UP!
&gt; Whether there's "a" gay gene isn't relevant. If there's any genetic basis for homosexuality, and lack of oppression means they don't have sham marriages that result in children, then gay rights = fewer gays.

Not necessarily. Even if there is a strong genetic factor involved, many homosexuals are now having children of their own -- either gay men finding surrogate mothers, or lesbians artificially inseminating themselves. I suspect that this trend is likely to increase.
You know, the saddest part of this parody is that the only unrealistic part of that is the fold-out system requirements. Everything else looks _exactly_ like an MS product package. Yeesh.
Let me guess: you used Scheme as the implementation language.  That's probably why FPLs seemed easier to implement.

Try a non-strict FPL like Haskell or Miranda next -- implementing these requires a radically different approach (which, I'd add, Simon Peyton Jones does an excellent job of explaining in the above-cited book ...)
I'm on the other end of the equation.  I've good tech skills and a willingness to work/learn but finding the environment to do something is difficult.

Yes, I'm picky about my tools and the project, if I'm going to work hard I have to believe in the idea and that everything is being done to achieve said.

The one thing I was thinking about was CraigsList, the cost is right, you don't have to use the jobs pages, gigs or relationships(!) would probably work just as well.

What I think will probably happen is that for this sort of stuff over the web there'll need to be a site were people go to see who is doing what and what roles are available.  FreshMeat/SourceForge seems to do this well for OpenSource.  Think of it as a community of founders.  One group of founders brings ideas another brings tech skills.    


&gt; Was there a military tribunal for Timothy McVeigh?  That is a completely arbitrary distinction.

Allow me make a clear distinction in the example you provided with Timothy McVeigh.  The individuals at Guantanamo Bay were captured on foreign soil in a recognized theater of military conflict and were foreign agents.  Timothy McVeigh's status fulfilled none of these conditions.

&gt; That sounds like the distinction between civilians and non-civilians, and foreign and domestic organizations.

Thank you for catching my "civilian"-"citizen" mixup.  I meant to assign the statement to non-civilians.  

Non-civilians captured in a military operation should not receive the full breadth of judicial oversight that civilians do.  There is clearly a necessary separation of powers where the executive branch, when exercising its war powers, cannot have every action possibly scrutinized and struck down by the judicial branch.
I have a similar problem. I made some not exactly great decisions about school and the like when I was younger (I'm 24 now). As a result, I don't know very many people who seem like they'd make good cofounders.

Right now, I'm doing contract work for a web startup founded by three guys with business degrees and no programming experience. I declined their offer of partnership in their LLC for reasons most people here can probably figure out. I'm very interested in starting a startup of my own with one or two like-minded people, or joining an early-stage startup.

thanks. just so they know: "We've worked with the developers of the Firefox FlashBlock extension to make sure sIFR text is automatically degraded to (X)HTML for users of recent versions of FlashBlock. When users install FlashBlock, they are demonstrating a bias against Flash (most likely because of the incredible amount of obnoxious and invasive advertising on the web these days) and we want to respect this bias. If users don't want to see Flash, we don't want to show it to them. sIFR runs fine under other extensions like AdBlock, but users can always disable the loading of sifr.js if they'd like."

Ok, so you were wrong when you said "dealing with terrorism is a military matter and not of a civilian nature"? Glad we could clear that up.

And so you are incorrect when you say that if someone may have been involved in terrorism, we cannot have judicial oversight. If they were captured in a war zone, while participating in a war, then of course I agree they are not subject to the criminal courts. They are prisoners of war.

So what were you doing throwing around "suspected terrorist" everywhere? WTF does that have to do with civilian-noncivilian? What was your point?

Why are you making the link between feminism, priests and homosexuality?

Feminists and priests/nuns are products of cognitive choices, perhaps their disposition is in someway influenced by genetics, but I've never heard a feminist, priest or nun say "I didn't choose to be a feminist/priest/nun, its who I am"

I think those three are higher level social effects then homosexuality, just because they all don't like to make babys, doesn't mean they all came about the same way.

I agree with your logic on gay rights could equal fewer gays (although, what about "test tube babies" or surrogates) but I don't think you can extend the arguement to other groups of people that choose to put themselves in positions where they will not reproduce.

It's all economics. Some markets, such as Reddit-like sites, are flooded with free sites and are no longer a viable business. Other markets, such as online retail, have a healthy amount of competition so you don't have to put up with shit, but there can also be a viable business. Then there's the mobile phone ring-tone market, where cell phone megacorps have used copyright and closed delivery platforms to limit competition and get people to pay ridiculous amounts of money for images and ring tones.
I think this was brilliant. They didn't do anything stupid like "break the law" and didn't intentionally harm anyone. They were following the law just to show how ridiculous it is. Good stuff.
I would argue that finding a great business partner is explained by the same economic principles as buying a used car - they're both lemon markets.

Just like you don't know what kind of car you're buying until you own it - its very hard to know how good a partner is until you're working with him (or at least good friends with him). 

I've experienced this myself in my efforts to find good hackers/partners here at UVA.  Although I've gotten a lot of interest from my facebook ads - it has been very difficult to discern who has the skills / passion necessary to dedicate to a potential project.

This information asymmetry  seems to be a huge constraint on potential startups - think of how many more partnerships would be possible if you were not restricted to those you knew intimately.

An interesting thought - finding a good business partner is a lot like finding a good life partner.  You really have to get to know him / her over several months before you can have any concept as to whether the partnership will be successful.  Sigh, at least the dating market is more evolved.
I'm thinking that the best partners are those that have completely different but complementing tasks while still having a good knowledge of how the other's job works. This way has many benefits. Each person can boast about his accomplishments, neither can slack and make the other do everything.

Oh hey, maybe it is like dating-- just get employees on a job to job basis. No long term commitment! Less expensive in the long term too;)

Actually Camping looks about the same in that regard. Making something more abstracted does not necessarily reduce how complicated it is to use.

To be honest, I implemented them in C# 2.0 and targetted the .NET virtual machine. It's the dynamic languages that allow variable mutation that are the hardest to get "right". (non crappy code output). The pure functional languages allow me to do complete static typing that really improves the output code.

So to answer your sarcasm: no, not everyone here has gone to MIT and not everyone has implemented Scheme in Scheme (in Scheme). Though, I do love SICP and SICM.

I have also implemented a good portion of C# 1.0 -- everything but events (not needed) and unsafe code (pain in the ass).

I never tried implementing Haskell (I barely know the language). Which parts of Haskell do you find the most challenging to implement? Haskell just doesn't present anything new that I have needed (to date).

I implemented Scheme as my first language (in C#, with help from lisp in small pieces, did not implement the macro system). Then C#, then Erlang, then JavaScript. I implemented each when I had a business need to do so. These are not acedemic implementations, I use them every day.

Advertising. Every day the web becomes a larger part of our entertainment. I know **many** people that spend **most** of their time fooling around online. This is displacing many other leisure time activities we once had.

Alright, so what if you can get 1 out of every 1000 people who visit your site to buy the advertised product due to your advertisements.. What happens when you have 5 billion hits a day.  What do you have when you achieve a brand recognition that goes so deep that mom, dad and the dog have all heard it? A lot.

Advertisement and recognition (which you can use for payed products later) is the profit model of the companies that your talking about now. Nothing new here.

&gt; Ok, so you were wrong when you said "dealing with terrorism is a military matter and not of a civilian nature"? Glad we could clear that up.

Good catch!

I should have been more clear and stated that I was directing my attention to terrorism *involving foreign actors.*  Because as you have indicated, it is of a different matter than when it occurs domestically.

And I concede the point to you that while it is obvious the al Qaeda detainees are suspected terrorists, the same cannot be said for the Taliban detainees.  There are only marginally better by being *unlawful combatants.*

However, your nuance implies that there are only two possible treatments in the current prosecution of Guantanamo detainees by the American government - criminally, with the full rights afforded to the accused by the Constitution, or as *bona fide* prisoners of war, with the full rights accorded to them as the American government has agreed to in its treaties and through international law.

If that implication is correct, then I wholeheartedly disagree.  There is certainly a class (or even classes) of combatants who are not behaving to the high bar international law demands for classification as prisoners of war, but who are certainly non-civilian militants.

International law is clear on this matter:  When you engage in warfare that specifically targets civilians (or hides behind them as targets), you have forfeited certain legal protections and privileges, including P.O.W. status.

dupe.
What bothers me about religion is that they want you to treat a prophet like he's (invariably it's a he) a famliy member. It's like a exploit of the "love people who are nice to you" instict. 

I dont need more family- I need good ideas. Bad ideas slow us down and cost money.
I find this to be mildly unlikely because of a historical argument: homosexuality was wildly popular (to the point where it was equally normal to find males and females attractive, if you were male), but Greece continued for probably about a thousand years in this state, and in fact grew to be a reasonably-sized empire at several points. I am under the impression that pressures of sexual selection on genetics generally take slightly shorter than that to take effect.

correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Washington cross the icy waters of the Potomac, something that doesn't happen quite (as ) often these days?  Would Europe's mini ice-age have affected the US as well, or could we simply say it was a natural cycle unaffected by by man, or the lack thereof in this case?

Love this town and great site.
You are operating under the same mentality as other commenters to the article have:  That there are only two options - citizens under criminal courts and P.O.W.'s under Geneva.

Do you recognize a third category of detained individuals who do not fit into either category?  If not, then how do you explain the historic treatment of pirates, brigands, and spies?

Also, if you could please provide a reference to something showing that U.S. citizens are being held as detainees in Guantanamo, I would be most appreciative.  I can't seem to find anything credible on the topic.
So...it's a wiki?

It's completely against the law. In some states it'd be illegal for obstructing traffic. In other states it would be illegal use of the passing lanes.

I'm delighted that someone would highlight the inanity and unenforceability of our traffic laws, but I'm rather dismayed that they'd choose such a reckless way to do it. It looks like no one got hurt directly, but they could have done real damage to someone stuck in that traffic jam. They'll never know.
Methinks ham radio will never be mainstream enough to satisfy the majority of bloggers.  (And I am a ham operator.)  Not to mention you need special equipment. And how would blogging work that way?  Do you mean like a podcast, or data using packet radio?

My guess is that it will wiki-fy the entire web stack. Despite appearing a bit bare currently, it did add on the ability to edit the site template right in the wiki, which I hadn't seen in any others yet. So maybe it'll do the same for URL mapping, data modelling, and other aspects.
Hmm.  Seems kinda lame.  :/  Especially with Google Pages having launched in the past couple days.
Yeah I was underwhelmed too. PBWiki already offers everything Infogami does and more. http://pbwiki.com/

For it to stand out from the wiki crowd Infogami should have done something novel like I don't know.. a Subetha style collaborative editing page done in Ajax?

And not even an RSS feed on the development blog. Lame.

What to do? hehe. leave them alone- it's a free country. I wont get in their  way of life, liberty, or property, and I expect the same from them. So long as their bad ideas dont get in the way of my work, I tolerate. Personaly, I don't do the whole "personal surrender to outside authority" thing, but other people can if they want. 

Some religious ideas are as dangerous as they are bad, but the more you fight with them, the more they infect the people who believe them. So you work around it. You listen,  you teach, and you work. Real problems don't get solved by prayer, but by hard work and dedication of able minds. There's a lot of good to do in this world- cures to be found, products to be made, software to be written. The religious can have whatever flavor of Pat Robertson their group requires. He- and his bad ideas- are only going to slow them down.

I disagree. This video seems typical of cops around the world. In my life experiences, any time you debate a cop, they feel threatened and will act accordingly. I've found it's the rare cop who has it together to handle banter. Besides, they're not trained to debate the merits of an argument, they're trained to protect the public by upholding the law. Sometimes that protection thing is confused with status and law is a restraint by which they're annoying bound. Don't debate cops under any circumstance. Take it to your politicians.

The Pie Fallacy

"I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy."

"It sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality. When you phrase it that way, who can argue with you? Inequality has to be bad, right? It sounds a good deal less benevolent to say we ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded. And yet the one implies the other."

I am in Moscow, Russia, now. I am not a hacker, though.
I'm not sure what it is you're disagree with. I never said that sort of behavior is uncommon - just that it gives cops a bad name.

As for debate, it's fine if they're unwilling to debate, and quite a few of the cops shown *were* professional about it. The correct response is "Sorry, we don't have complaint forms. I can take your complaint/direct you to the appropriate supervisor/etc...." Those cops only got a couple seconds each on the video. Being confrontational with someone who obviously isn't doing anything wrong and already has a complaint about your department is totally unacceptable.
Infogami seems subtly different from a wiki. I think it is more like Backpack. Perhaps somewhere in between a wiki and Backpack.
With a little work, this would be perfect for creating and managing personal web sites. I mean web sites for typical users, not web geeks. I'm not sure if markdown is simple enough for that market, but it is a good start.

[Genetic drift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift) will do it:

&gt; Given sufficiently long time, however, the mathematics of genetic drift (cf. random walk) predict the allele will either die out or be present in 100% of the population, after which time there is no random variation in the associated gene. In this regard, genetic drift tends to sweep gene variants out of a population over time

In the absence of some opposing process, it becomes statistically inevitable. See also http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genetic-drift.html

Edit: This was in regard to the bottom 3 paragraphs, not the feasibility of the prediction.

It's not a personality trait like aggressiveness or docility, though.  There are probably a few women out there who genuinely hate men and get overcome with the urge to castrate every man they lay eyes on, but the vast majority of feminists believe in feminism on an intellectual level, not as an innate part of their personality.

Nah, I think the Microsoft Word team already tried this.
If the Europeans don't change the rules and start looking after the natives, they will face extinction, and it's as simple as that.  Fukuyama was accurate in that Europe should have addressed this problem decades ago and has largely missed the boat.

He frowns upon the nationalist approach which includes isolationism, protectionism, and religious revival, but it is the only viable option on the table.

Europe and America wanted all the benefits of a society where morality and ethnic awareness take a back seat to economic prosperity and social experimentation, and none of the downsides.  Well, the chickens have come home to roost now, haven't they?

I'm with you, though.  If somebody has a better idea on how to reverse the impending death of Western civilization, let's hear it.

Even if the Muslim presence in Europe wasn't an issue, Europe would still be headed for suicide.  The birth rate is well below replacement levels, and I hear that some nations *require* immigration by the *millions* each year just to keep their economies from shrinking.  Italy and Spain come to mind.

America is not far behind.  Our prostitution of immigrant (and migrant) Hispanics and refusal to procreate is only going to go so far before social unrest becomes an issue, as it has in Europe.

tail-call removal has been discussed as an option for Python at least since Stackless Python debuted. i'm still not sure exactly why it hasn't been adopted; as i understand it, the reasons are partly technical (something to do with the C-stack usage in regular CPython) but at least as much political.

really, i don't understand why anybody should still be designing languages without tail-call removal. it's a plenty well enough known and studied optimization; it should be considered a standard trick whenever a person starts to write an optimizing compiler, IMO. i've always thought lacking it was one of Python's few real flaws.

hehe, jo takk. Det var jeg som postet den linken og så kommenterte det selv, så enig i at det var en god link. Enda bedre den første linken jeg postet som var orginalnyheten fra guardian.co.uk

og helt greit med nyheter fra kjente sider, som du ser har jeg postet endel av dem også, men my point still stands...

Forøvrig kan folk generellt være litt mer positive her inne, da det ligge ri internett-diskusjoners natur at ting misforstås og folk blir grinete. Så la oss holde oss unna flaming, og gi poitiv feedback - selv om det må være takhøyde for en diskusjon om sidens "formål"
Microsoft sell 10x more software than Apple because they have an effective monopoly on desktop and office-productivity software, making them the de-facto standard that people must interoperate with, and then try as hard as they can to keep their protocols and interfaces secret to prevent anyone else from interoperating with them.

Look at an area where they don't have a stranglehold already (like web servers, iTunes-type online stores, etc) and you'll see that Apple and open-source software (with a fraction of Microsoft's advetising budget, or no advertising at all) is regularly eating their lunch.
So chocolate halves my risk of dying...and smoking pot makes me smarter...holy crap I'm on my way to becoming an immortal genius.
If you look at the current effective population sizes (say, for the United States), you will quickly realize that it would take billions of years for genetic drift to have this effect.

I could have used this a couple weeks ago, always good to have a guide specific to your platform.
&gt; ...made it sound like a huge invention that would revolutionize the Internet.

Haven't you heard? That's what Web 2.0 is.

But really I think AaronSw has always had a big head. His comments are more or less along the lines of "(insert app here) is the greatest thing out there."


&gt; Unfortunately this amazing system is pretty much invisible to the outside world, but it's going to allow us to quickly build software that's more advanced than anything else out there. - Infogami

&gt; Python, on the other hand, has problems of its own. The biggest is that it has dozens of web application frameworks, but none of them are any good. Pythonists are well aware of the first part but apparently not of the second, since when I tell them that I'm using my own library, the universal response is "I don't think Python needs another web application framework". Yes, Python needs fewer web application frameworks. But it also needs one that doesn't suck. ... he then continues on into how/why his framework fixes all the problems - web.py

Anyway, for some guys the arrogance works (Larry Wall). Others not so much (any number of Internet programmers who thought they were something but still nobody has any clue who they are).

The main problem is, I don't see a clear audience for Infogami. The kind of people that visit Reddit generally aren't going to use it, and your everyday Joe isn't ever going to hear about it.
Wildly unsubstantiated rumours of course, but interesting stuff. I wouldn't put it past them.

I suspect that subreddits will eventually lead to tags.  So you would be able to tag a URL with cs, programming, and whatever else you want.  With a reasonable mechanism for promoting and demoting URLs with respect to a subset of their tags, there may not be a need to keep the number of subreddits small.  In such a scenario, there would be no need to suggest subreddits at all.
Yes, it could be argued. It's illegal to drive faster than the speed limit.
I see no real problem with the current crossposting of articles that pertain to more than one subreddit as is done now. The key to this is not creating too many subreddits that would overlap.

To further jesusphreak's idea, if we were to make a subreddit on programming it should cover material that is not already well covered by the main reddit. Perhapse an in depth `functional programming` reddit since those usually score low or a `python cookbook` reddit?
I think it was very clever. They should do it like... 3 times a week. Then maybe it will make a difference.
I would like that.
Could you elaborate?  Why is it important to avoid overlap? When promoting/demoting/browsing URLs, you would specify one or more tags.
I'm in London as well.  (we're talking about Ontario, right?)
Or a live chat reddit.. since you replied to my comment in about 10 seconds haha.

Its important to avoid overlap because then a submitter would end up posting everything to several subreddits and this would diminish the value of having subreddits in the first place. They would all end up very similar.
What do YOU know about RSS? :P
these are great! :)
So how do you get that "don't influence each other" part right in the real world? Kill off the financial press?
So what if, for example, programming and cs subreddits/tags have lots of overlap? As long as you allow people to promote/demote URLs with respect to multiple tags, then there should not be a problem. When browsing, you could specify whatever tag(s) you want.
Brilliant idea to jumpstart with existing reddit users. Now the question is if you can get enough small services to federate their userbases, like AdultKey &amp; such. Once again, porn showed us the way....
What's the difference between crossposting to multiple usenet newsgroups and to multiple reddits?

As the number of users scales up I suspect there will be no difference between the two at all. Cross-posting will be considered spamming.
A key quality of reddit is that its interface is very simple. There are more complex interfaces out there but the simplicity of two arrows makes reddit somewhat unique.

Tags would add a whole other level of work in setting organizing one's favorites.
fucking spam
Reddit penalizes spam, so cross-posting (or using multiple tags) would be quite acceptable.
Exactly. We don't want to be deprived of interesting, relavent links because the submitter was afraid to post to too many groups.
what's the diff between the two?
Yes, tags would add a new level of complexity.  But they might be better than some arbitrary selection of subreddits.
I just watched a huge show on the history channel about the little ice age and oddly enough all of the theories it presented dealt more with the little ice age starting, then th e black plauge coming on a ship from asia - and the little ice age contributing to the high death rates of the plague.

There were three theories put forth for the start of the little ice age on the show none of them had it started due to the plague.

This link gives an overview of the show.. It was pretty good.

When you spam reddit, people will demote your URLs, thus making it less likely that your future URL submissions will end up as a recommendation for them. This in turn reduces the chances that you can spread news in the future, since fewer people will likely see your URL.

This penalty for spamming applies to crossposting also, so crossposting should not be a problem.
Agreed, reddit should just examine this and other methods carefully so as to avoid coming off as a cheep clone of the 500 other *tagging* sites out there.
I think I now understand the difference between usenet groups and subreddits: usenet groups didn't have a ranking system. Here if you post your story to irrelevant subreddits you will find yourself modded down in them.

One crucial capability we would need with these subreddits is duplication-removal. Does reddit already do this? If I've hidden reddit.com/info?id=N, do is sub.reddit.com/info?id=N hidden from me?
I'm just saying that deciding on all the groups to post to, that is if their are many similar groups, places a heavier burden on the the submitter. This burden is quite light with the current system.
[removed]
My guess is yes. A more difficult problem is handling the reccomendations across subreddits though. How would reddit best do this?
The submitter can pick whatever tags he/she wants.  Others could later submit the same URL with other tags and be rewarded for it.
[deleted]
I agree. merging this thread with http://request.reddit.com/info?id=2cdh#c2df6

Sorry about the crosstalk.
But would this come too close to being a delicous clone?
Word is over on Scoble's blog that the video actually came FROM Microsoft.
tags/subreddits seem like a stopgap solution; if we had a good recommendation engine we wouldn't need tags.

Or perhaps tags could be aids to the recommendation engine. Hmm..
Well, you never know what del.icio.us will do. It might be that both services will eventually converge to something similar. But so what?
But I enjoy several non related fields. Soccer and functional programming for example. I don't want people's reccomendations from one influencing the reccomendations I get in another for obvious reasons.

del.icio.us is already huge and has heavy financial backing. Do we really want to fight them at their own game?
[deleted]
I don't understand. If they're unrelated there's unlikely to be overlap between them anyway, right?

What I meant was that tags could help a recommendation engine. Instead of like delicious inbox where you have to specify what tags you care about, you leave it up to the great algorithm in the sky, and it can be arbitrarily smart about using all the information about a post - all the tags and all the comments and the identities of people who posted - in deciding if you'll be interested.
[deleted]
yes. hmmm..

For large, faced paced threads like this I think it would be useful if reddit had a bar, on the right side, that could list the most recent comments on the page. You could just click the link and jump right to the comment.

Good idea?
Good point. The recomendation engine is in sore need of some improvements.

Perhapse the arrows alone are not enough data for effective recomendation in the first place?
Yeah. One better: an interface like gmail where the most recent comments bubble to the top, but attached to their threads/context. Especially if modding things up/down makes them read, I think this would mix nicely with the current ordering algorithm.

Except part of my point was that perhaps we don't even need two panels. We already have the main panel being sorted by date and mod points; I think adding read/unread state and the ability to collapse parents would mix well with this.
There is a time and place for everything. Once every month there is a time when a woman experiences a physical internal change, a feminine mystery that no man can ever fully comprehend. But at this time in her cycle, you notice emotional changes too, symptoms of near psychosis that make you question her sanity and keeps the 5 letter b-word close to your lips. You know it’s her time of the month, but the question is, how to keep this seemingly temporarily bi-polar woman in her place, and how you can get through her PMS without having to go MIA.

Guess you didn't read the linked article where Swartz explains that basically none of the features are implemented yet.  Right now it's just an infrastructure.
Comment folding would be good. I haven't seen that in many discussion boards either.

Running with the google groups example: For gg, when you view a topic you can only see maybe 15 comments per "page" in the frames view. This has the advantage in that only that many messages are marked as viewed which is especially useful in a large thread that you have to take a break from reading and come back to later.

Aside from this problem with overmarking of comments as viewed, I think that this is a good idea. A simple color change at the header of the comment would work. This was mentioned in another thread somewhere around here.

I think the reddit guys should go for it.

One more thing. The minimum width on these comments needs to be increased just a bit. Wait, I know:

horrible fuckin title

Where does wrongful arrest get decided? Not out in the highway, that's for sure.

My point is this: when a cop comes to your car or door and tells you you're doing something wrong, that is prob not the right time to disagree with them. Not because they hold a gun or anything, but just because they're trained not to let us civilians change their minds. This training is there for a reason: otherwise cops would be getting into arguments with lawyers all over our roads.

The cop follows his training, and the judge later decides the law. That's the division of labour.
If they wanted to make a point they should have waited for a police officer to come up behind them and then get in formation, unable to speed up even tho he wanted to pass them (until he turned on his lights). All they did there was make life hell for a lot of other people who also felt the speed limit was ridiculous. If they wanted to make people call and complain there are better ways than antagonizing them.

But then, it was probably more about this 'cool' video than standing up for something if they might get in trouble.
big head - *yes.* Reinventing the wheel all over the place - *yes.* Are these bad? - not entirely..

Despite the old myths of [*insert latest programming fad*] making software completely reusable and flexible, often times it is better just to start over. From what I've seen, aaron's projects have demonstrated clear improvements over existing technology. This is what pushes the improvement of even the dustiest code.

As for the big head stuff, its not my style but he more or less backs it up. Maybe some of us should be more boastful when we deserve it?
Unfortunately, you guys are both right.  Infogami is just an in-place CSM for wiki/blog sites.  I'm guessing the pinnacle will be a graphical (drag-and-drop) interface for modifying page layouts.  Maybe we're missing something?


But that doesn't explain why us college graduates and technology workers should be pleased that the super rich are reaping the rewards of economic growth, while we actually get paid *less*.

Most of us are never going to get the big payout from a successful startup.

Haha, while this may be true, it sure doesn't help you utilize them.

wow.  a very disturbing / frustrating / infuriating video

even more disturbing to me was the official response from most of the police stations -- "no comment"

Seems to me that objectively describing something as "fair" is in the same realm as objectively calling someone "beautiful."

We're living in a police state. I tell you man, it ain't that great.

I'm glad I'm a Canadian - I wonder if it's different up here. I really hope it is.
&gt;However, I think the main point is this: if you are clever 
&gt;enough to hack Python to remove its pointless and 
&gt;irritating limitations, you might as well fix Python (if 
&gt;you want to keep using it), or abandon the thing and start 
&gt;using tools that don't have the unnecessary and irritating 
&gt;limitations.

how i wish any one of those things were true for me. but i'm not (clever enough -- that decorator hack went tantalizingly just a few inches above my head), and i can't (fix python -- it's not my baby, and i can't go using nonstandard programming environments willy-nilly), and i can't (abandon tools i happen to not like -- i'm not working for myself).

if i could do any of those three, then i would pick #3, and abandon Perl for Python. because i *maintain other people's Perl code for a living,* and that should tell you just how badly damned i am.

my daily struggles involve introducing at least some basic level of OO abstractions and code reuse in the scripts i maintain, along with trying to migrate old scripts onto standard CPAN modules instead of hand-hacked, nonstandard code that nobody maintains and noone ever bothered to document. i'd *love* to fix Python... but then again, i'd be extatic to be able to even use it, broken as it may be. call me a schmuck, but *that's not possible under my current business requirements.*
Wow.  It this was a printed story I don't know if I would have believed it but to see the footage.   All off those officers should be fired on the spot.

I agree with sudoman, watch the second video its a lot better.
Actually, the community here is bigger than all of the "Lisp-fanatics and Paul-Graham-adherents" in the world. There are a lot of people interested in science and politics here, as can be seen by the sites that make it to the top.

Also, "Paul-Graham-adherents" is an absolutely ridiculous insult. All of the people I've met who read Paul Graham religiously think for themselves, and disagree with him on a number of issues.

I guess you can't expect any more than gross oversimplification bordering on nonsense from the media.

&gt; Bayes' Theorem. Despite the esoteric symbols, the idea--roughly speaking--is simple: The likelihood that something will happen can be plausibly estimated by how often it occurred in the past.

That's not [Bayes' Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem), that's the [problem of induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction). In other words, that's not mathematics, that's philosophy.
The Canadian health care system is one of the best in the world. It is of course not free, but certainly much more affordable that anything private health insurance could offer, and universally accessible. There is a lot of pressure from American private health care providers against our system, but fortunately Canadians seem to know better. I et the feeling this sort of film is an attempt to mislead Americans who are beginning to wonder if there isn't a better system than the very costly and inefficient one they have now. Don't let the corporate interests pull the wool over your eyes. Choose what is best for you.

More to the point, it's something that other people can't duplicate easily (because cell services have control of the network), and so they can keep competition from driving the price down.
My guess is that Sun doesn't want HTX because NUMA systems built from HTX-slot interconnects will make their high end kit look a bit overpriced by comparison.
So they could acquire the founders of said site, 2 programmers who have a track record of being able to deliver a product that people will use.

Given that Google's market cap is $19mil/employee, the two Reddit founders would actually be worth somewhat less than the average Google employee.

I think, to some degree starting a startup requires a big head. The vast majority of startups fail; believing yours won't implies you think you're somehow better than most of the other people with startups.

On the other hand, it requires being humble enough to notice when it becomes apparant that your original idea is flawed, to take advice from other smart people and make the changes required for success.

I live in Portland, Oregon. There is a group of bike riding nutjobs that will occassionally go en-masse on the freeway. Traffic is stalled by it and there are never enough cops to hunt them all down when the police do respond.

I have always wanted a few of those rubber pellet grenades for exactly that kind of thing. Demonstrations are fine, but make sure they target the people who are causing the problem, not those who suffer from it.
[deleted]
what a perfect way to avoid writing my thesis.
And if you slowed down JUST a little while driving on the freeways, you'd see some of those tiny markers indicating fatal accidents. 

40,000+ people a year in America alone. And the number is actually rising. 

Like it or not, they were driving slow and safe. And the response they got by fellow motorists was insanity. 

Its like the old saying: "Speed kills. But it gets you there faster."

The NY Times reports that [the Canadian health care system is impoding](http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2006/02/the_death_of_th.html)!


*"This is a country in which dogs can get a hip replacement in under a week and in which humans can wait two to three years."*

But there is some good news for Canadians needing medical services:

*The country's publicly financed health insurance system — frequently described as the third rail of its political system and a core value of its national identity — is gradually breaking down. Private clinics are opening around the country by an estimated one a week, and private insurance companies are about to find a gold mine.*
We'll see how this goes.

I still want to see links from subreddits that I enjoy (programming in particular) on the main reddit page. Will the recommended system or something like that soon allow this?
My prior for news.com.com producing a technically accurate article is very close to 0.  And with the evidence from this article, my posterior is even closer to 0.  Still, there's a good argument for the existence of articles like this, because lay people have to be introduced to the field somehow.  And though such articles seem shallow and even inaccurate in many cases, people have to  start their understanding somewhere.  It should just be stressed to people that the information gleaned from such articles should be taken with a grain of salt.

Also, the argument of many people in statistics and machine learning is that Baye's Rule *is* the correct solution to the problem of induction.  In my opinion, [Jaynes](http://bayes.wustl.edu/) is the most articulate advocate of that position.
I've never used Lotus Notes, but [this article on Guardian Unlimited](http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1705106,00.html) makes me inclined to agree with you (emphasis mine).

&gt; *Imagine a program used by 120 million people, of whom about 119m hate it.* Sound unlikely? Yet that's the perception one garners in trying to discover whether Lotus Notes, IBM's "groupware" application, is - as readers of Technology blog suggested - the "world's worst application". The discussions (at http://tinyurl.com/e4a56 and http://tinyurl.com/d9gdk) suggest that those who have used it are united: *to the average person, Notes displays all the user-friendliness of a cornered rat.*

&gt; ...Fast-forward to today, and Notes has gained widespread takeup: users in the UK include British Airways, Toyota, Volkswagen, Standard Life Assurance and most major newspaper groups (including Guardian Media Group). But further investigation shows that *its proponents tend to be administrators, and its detractors the end users.*

Ouch.
OK I read his Q&amp;A, but it gave me the impression that he's just yet another pop journo making a living from feeding people their own prejudices. His premise is that groups can sometimes do certain things well (it apparently only recently occurred to him and he sells this as a new vision). He freely interchanges wisdom, smartness, intelligence, effectiveness, problem-solving and crystal ball-gazing as if they were the same thing and then confuses collective decision-making with collective _knowledge_.  He tells us that groups are good at  finding solutions to problems that have a right answer (tell that to Einstein), and that they are bad at problems of skill such as flying a plane or performing surgery (strange then that these jobs happen to be best performed by groups, just like many other skill-based activities such as football and music). He then says that the members of the group have to be independently-minded or the decision-making tends to fail catastrophically as a get-out for the many examples where his proposal flies in the face of what actually happens. So he's not even arguing hive intelligence here. Using betting odds as an example of the higher efficiency of the crowd over the expert, he seems unaware that those odds are set by experts with bookies beating punters every day. Yes, groups have a greater pool of knowledge than the individual but this is barely worth stating. Before I read this guy's stuff I assumed that groups would probably make effective decisions although not _wise_ ones; he's now pretty much  convinced me that not even this is true.

A relational database for trees? Forget this junk. I'm currently doing some nice tree work with [btrees](http://www.zope.org/Members/ajung/BTrees/DataTypes/FrontPage) in [ZODB](http://www.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage). Their syntax is almost a drop in replacement for dictionaries- the way you'd usually store trees in python.

Everything works great so far and its very scalible. This is my first major project where I've stored trees in a database but I looked for a good while and this seemed to be the best solution.

See http://www.python.org/topics/database/persistence.html for a few more.
I think the fact that someone is arguing the value of crazy frog over google because "that's what the market says" shows the ideological and artificial nature of letting the market decide anything.
"The documents included legal memos from one Jones Day attorney to another regarding allegations by activists that Diebold had used uncertified voting systems in Alameda County elections beginning in 2002."

So the guy stole attorney work product protected under privilege and HE'S the whistle-blower-hero? Ignoring the content of the documents, I'm a little more concerned that a paralegal can steal confidential information relating to a legal matter and some people here are OK with that.
Keep it simple.  Too many subreddits will make it hard to know if an interesting web page belongs in the main reddit or another subreddit.  I agree that this eventually leads to a world of tagging.

Instead of making lots of subreddits, shouldn't the "recommended" page be able to theoretically capture a person's interest?  I liked something I read on a different comment thread about how the act of clicking a link would correlate with interest in the subject and clicking the up/down arrow suggests the quality of the article (not the interest/agreement level of the user).

It seems like most reddit users have lots of interests and don't want to try and browse all N of their favorite subreddits in order to make sure they are not missing anything good.  That's what is so great about having a single main reddit page and why I check it every day (several times).
The Canadian health care system is fine.  Most of the people who whine about single-payer programs are flacks for the US insurance industry or willingly ignorant.

There are many alternatives to the corporate rationing we have in the United States.  Each one has it's pros and cons.  To scare Americans with lies about the state of Canadian heath care is intellectually dishonest.

It's time Americans stopped treating health care like a privilege.

If the titles of links are most of the time misleading, so why you read them at all?  Clicking links randomly could yield better results in this case.  If you, on the other hand, believe that the titles *do* improve the rate of interesting articles, then why should a filter be unable to learn from your clicking data?

An alternative to learning from clicks could be to regard articles as relevant if I rated them -- regardless whether positive or negative.  If I read an article *and* rate it, I probably find its topic interesting.  Misleading title problem solved!  (But then: What if I donwrate an article because it's spam?)
using mod_gzip with Apache is another option that probably results in smaller files.

I'm a TurboGears user and was actually a little disappointed with this. I thought the code for these examples could have been simpler and smaller.

Interesting point - but I would say the difference is that nowadays, people tend to be characterized as straight or gay, whereas in ancient Greece one was pushed more towards  bisexuality - which means that men with homosexual tendencies might still have children, whereas I would guess that if a study were done nowadays, men would be much more likely to classify themselves as straight and often have children or as gay and not.

yep. stupid article. I think we all realise it is a bit harder to live an ethical lifestyle, the point being, the more we do it, the easier it will be in the future.

Yet, I fail to see a moral or a follow-up to this story. That some people have it better because of un-earned privilege is a truism in modern capitalist society, but it was so in communist states, in fascist states, and (much more so) in pre-capitalist times.
Also: do I smell a weak pun in writing "iniquity" when you mean "inequ(al)ity"?

negative as well. ethical lifestyle is not the same as guilt-free consumerism. they're maybe orthogonal, and possibly there's actually a negative correlation (saintly people spend their time in better ways than looking for the right blend of coffee).
Call it cspapers.reddit.com then.

It doesn't matter if 99.9% of them were totally professional. It would be worth doing an expose even if these few cops were the only belligerent dickheads on the force.

It is downhill from there. The other officers who work with them will be taught the worst possible attitudes. If those guys are the *only* cops of their kind, it is indicative of a systemic problem that they have not already been identified and fired or better trained.

**Edit**: It appears from the video that when I said "few" I should have said "two". I still think the point stands. A friend of mine quit the SFPD because of attitudes like those. Think of the kind of person who *wouldn't* quit.

The entire goal of the flyer is to lie around the house long enough that someone orders one of the meal deals. At that point, they rely on the yummyness of the product to move further units.

How many people buy software this way? Okay, maybe some do... but I'd like to think that the majority have their minds made up by the time they hit the retail store. And thus, Apple can afford to make their packages beautiful rather than flashy.

I still have my doubts about that date.  The Feb CTP looks great on the surface but I'm running into major issues with it.  I can lock up my test machine pretty good at least once an hour.
I don't like that the prices are going up. $800 for a Mini seems a bit high in spite of the specs.
Index for sale!

I have the misfortune of having had to work with Lotus Notes for 8 years since it was in Release 3. (Now its at R7) Way back then it was quite useful (pre widespread internet) and it had some features that were unique and worked well (replication, the notes rpc and so on) but I can honestly say it is the most frustrating, stinking pile of unstable dogshit I have ever had to work with. Most notes "developers" have never used anything else so they dont see what I am getting at. Just to give one example, there is no way in the "development environment" (called "Designer" in notes) to search for a string accross more than one "agent".(I havent look at R7 yet) There are dozens and dozens of other broken things dont even get me started! Believe me its the last thing we need on the Linux desktop and I certainly hope it wont lead Microsoft here.
yeah, I thought it was about Cornel West's terrible struggle against narcolepsy.

"Sorry, I'll take an NTSC set any day of the week."

Are you serious ???

20% more lines is definitely significant, especially when your widescreen NTSC movie is using only 430 lines out of 480.

Cinema is 24 fps. It's more convenient to speed that up to 25 fps (PAL) than to interpolate or duplicate frames to reach 30 fps (NTSC).

You are raising an interesting issue with the compression ratio. There have been single-DVD and dual-DVD releases of each of the three movies, so the author should have mentioned which one he used in his comparison.

I'll take a dual-DVD PAL release any day of the week (versus a DRM-encumbered HD edition).

"Extremely distressing" news for the Linux community to be associated in any way with this steaming pile. The [reddit post from the Guardian](http://reddit.com/info?id=1dju) not long ago should provide context in case you didn't see it. Note the passion.

This info isn't right. The $800 Mini has an 80 gig drive, and a "Superdrive" DVD-burner, the cheaper Mini having a lesser drive (CD-RW/DVD), but no DVD-burner.

BTW, they've ditched the Radeon chipset and gone with integrated Intel graphics.

You can see the 1920x1080 images by clicking on the downsampled ones.

I'm still not convinced that the comparison is relevant though. Maybe the DVD captures happen to be I or B frames (interpolated, hence lower quality). Maybe the MPEG2 codecs are very different (some software decoders reduce the accuracy dynamically depending on CPU load).

It worked perfectly for me when I tested it, and, apparently, 13 other people. Leave your email address and I'll email it to you.

I make my judgements about piracy on a case-by-case basis. In this case, I think Feynman would be smiling in the afterlife to see people all over the world reading stories about him being awesome. I also think the way in which this book changed my life compels me to make sure as many people read it as possible, and linking to the Amazon reference does not achieve that.

P.S. I find your anti-piracy spiel a bit humorous considering how hard you tried to obtain the PDF. ;-)

Rails already feels somewhat bloated to me. I hope this doesn't add to that feeling.
Ah, the good ol' days, when your email address was a secret....
Anyone here have some real experience with Lua? It seems like a neat little language that is worth learning.
I agree, if infogami gets on Digg and del.icio.us/popular soon then that's the end, people who read those feeds will check it out, will find out that it's a zero feature wiki, will go away and not come back or pay attention when it gets mentioned in those places again. And why should they? It'll just be "infogami now can do what xxx cPanel feature does" or whatever, who cares? Certainly no one outside of the demographic of people who read [reddit|Digg|del.icio.us/popular], which is why it will never get publicity beyond that, and why initial publicity there is the kind you can least afford to waste.

Maybe Slashdot will hold off until infogami supports viewing site logs, and it'll get some bounce from that.

&lt;/cynic off&gt;
err... No. We have a valve, and muscles in the bladder wall, when contracted squeeze the urine out. A histology text book would have been easier then peeing while standing on your head.

"Due to heavy demand, we are unable to offer new accounts for today."
I disagree. If it costs 25c for someone at home to copy a CD, and you can give the artist $1 and that's more than they currently get, then why the hell does a CD got $20?!
Yes you can order it. They might not start shipping now though.
I was writing Lua code up until I went to check Reddit.  [Our game](http://vendetta-online.com/), meaning the server, client (well, the upcoming version 2 beta one anyway), and website, is nearly entirely written in Lua now.

It's worth learning just because it's so simple and there isn't all that much to know, and yet it's extremely powerful.  Kinda like Scheme with Algol syntax.  It's a very "pure" language with few warts, and it's very fun to program in.  Someone even wrote an x86 JIT for it now.

Maybe we should address the assumption that anxiety and depression always need to be treated with drugs. Often, there is a reason someone is feeling depressed or anxious that has nothing to do with an abnormal biochemical imbalance. And when you circumvent these reasons, you are treating the symptom of the problem...not the actual problem, which I find frightening.
Anxiety and depression are not coincidental to our lives and are NORMAL. We should pay attention to them, not blind ourselves to our own existence.
I find it odd that in a few of the transcripts they accuse the tester as to having mental problems or "issues". I would if they are trained to say that or if they have a lot of nut balls that try and file complaints. At any rate I hope I never have to file a complaint against a cop especially in Florida
It's a mistake to publicly release something this preliminary. This is especially true given the high level of anticipation, and expectation in the reddit community.

Also, I'd get rid of the apologetic quote on top of the site. Far from enhancing their credibility, I think it undermines it.

Ideas are cheap; implementation is everything. You need to be able to show some magic, even in early demos.
lotus notes sucks.
